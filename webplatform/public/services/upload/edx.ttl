Approximately two thirds of the course focus on the copyright system of the United States; the remainder is devoted to the laws pertaining to copyright and \"neighboring rights\" in other countries. Considerable attention is devoted to the relationship between copyright law and creative expression in a variety of fields: literature; music; film; photography; graphic art; software; comedy; fashion; and architecture. The course commences on January 28, 2013, and lasts for 12 weeks.Enrollment in the course is limited to 500 participants, who were selected through an application process. When admitting participants, the course organizers sought to create a group that is diverse along many dimensions, including country of residence, age, occupation, educational background, and gender. Applicants had to be at least 13 years old, have a good grasp of the English language, and be willing to devote eight hours per week to learning and discussing the material. Otherwise, however, there are no prerequisites for taking this course. In particular, no legal background is required.Several methods of instruction are used. Participants watch pre-recorded lectures, engage in interactive live webcasts of events in which guest speakers address especially controversial issues, discuss legal problems in online forums, and (most importantly) participate once a week in an 80-minute online seminar. Those seminars are taught by teaching fellows, all of whom are currently students at Harvard Law School.At the conclusion of the course, each participant takes a three-hour exam, designed to assess his or her knowledge of copyright law and policy. Those exams are graded by the teaching fellows. Participants who receive passing grades are to be awarded certificates of completion and provided written assessments of their degree of proficiency.HLS1x Copyright is an experimental course, with four different variants that allow Prof. Fisher and his team to experiment with different combinations of teaching materials and educational technologies. Enrollment for the course is limited because we believe that high-quality legal education depends, at least in part, upon supervised small-group discussions of difficult issues. Fidelity to that principle requires confining the course to the number of participants that can be supervised effectively by our 21 teaching fellows. The limit on the enrollment does not mean, however, that we are not allowing access to the course materials; to the contrary, they are made publicly available." ;

A member of the MIT faculty since 1984, Professor Grimson previously served as head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, as its associate department head, and as its education officer. Professor Grimson is internationally recognized for his research in computer vision, especially in applications in medical image analysis. He and his students have developed techniques for activity and behavior recognition, object and person recognition, image database indexing, image guided surgery, site modeling, and many other areas of computer vision.
Professor Grimson has been actively engaged with students throughout his career. For 25 years he lectured subject 6.001 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, and is now engaged in teaching 6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming and 6.01 Introduction to EECS. He has also taught undergraduate subjects in computer architecture, software engineering, and signal processing. In all, Professor Grimson has taught more than 10,000 MIT undergraduates and served as the thesis supervisor to almost 50 MIT PhDs.
Professor Grimson is a native of Saskatchewan, Canada. He received the BSc (Hons) degree in mathematics and physics from the University of Regina in 1975 and his PhD in mathematics in 1980 from MIT. He is a recipient of the Bose Award for Excellence in Teaching in the School of Engineering at MIT.

An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. As of Fall 2012, the on-campus version of CS50x is Harvard's largest course.Students who earn a passing grade on 8 problem sets (programming assignments - 15-20 hours each), 2 quizzes, and a final project will get an honor code certificate from HarvardX. Students may take CS50x at their own pace, starting anytime after October 15, 2012 and finishing anytime before April 15, 2013." ;

    dc:description "Introduction to Statistics: ProbabilityStatistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1000 students each year. Stat2.2x is the second of three five-week courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2.The focus of Stat2.2x is on probability theory: exactly what is a random sample, and how does randomness work? If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1, does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10? What is the law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population? What should you expect to happen \"just by chance\"? These are some of the questions we will address in the course.We will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples, discuss the factors that affect their accuracy, and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions.Be warned: by the end of Stat2.2x you will not want to gamble. Ever. (Unless you're really good at counting cards, in which case you could try blackjack, but perhaps after taking all these edX courses you'll find other ways of earning money.)As Stat2.2x is part of a series, the basic prerequisites are the same as those for Stat2.1x: high school arithmetic and good comprehension of English. In addition, you are expected to know the material of Stat2.1x, with particular emphasis on histograms, averages, SDs, and the normal curve.The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results." ;

You will also have the opportunity to be an experimental scientist in your very own laboratory — your kitchen. By following along with the engaging recipe of the week, taking measurements, and making observations, you will learn to think both like a cook and a scientist.

In this course, students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts, in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general.In Greek tradition, a hero was a human, male or female, of the remote past, who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue, as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures, ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans, but on a much larger scale. Further, despite their mortality, heroes, like the gods, were objects of cult worship – a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course.The original sources studied in this course include the HomericIliad

The questions we will take up include: Is extreme poverty a thing of the past? What is economic life like when living under a dollar per day? Are the poor always hungry?  How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is microfinance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be \"nasty, brutish and short\"? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene? And many others. At the end of this course, you should have a good sense of the key questions asked by scholars interested in poverty today, and hopefully a few answers as well." ;
