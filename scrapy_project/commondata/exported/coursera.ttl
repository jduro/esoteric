    dc:description "It is estimated that 5-8% of school-aged children and 4% of adults in the United States suffer from some form of attention deficit disorder and that the incidence of the disorder is increasing in the population. Although it is the most widely studied behavior disorder of childhood, its etiology remains unclear, its outcome is variable, and its treatment is complex and moderately successful. Advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of ADHD, pointing to key neural circuits involved in attention, behavioral control, learning, and reward maintenance that appear to be underperforming in patients with the disorder. Moreover, the etiology of this heterogeneous disorder points to the key role of genetic andenvironmental interactions during prenatal and perinatal periods. Over the past decade, new diagnostic and interventional approaches have enabled clinicians to better diagnose and treat ADHD across the lifespan, while longitudinal studies have elucidated the long-term impact of the disorder on health and adaptive functioning.This course is intended for students with a background in psychology and/or neuroscience who are interested in learning more about the complexities of ADHD from both scientific and clinical perspectives. Scientific topics covered include prevalence and epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation at different ages, impact on development (intellect, academic, speech and language, emotional self control, motivation and executive functioning), health outcomes (risk taking, accidents, injuries, driving difficulties, unintended pregnancy), co-existing conditions (anxiety, mood, substance use disorders), and etiology (genetic, pre/perinatal, neurodevelopmental, neuroanatomic, neuropsychological). Clinical topics covered include approaches to assessment, medication treatments (stimulant and non-stimulant), and non-medical interventions." ;

    dc:description "This course explores the history of the modern world since Chinggis Khan. It focuses on the connections between societies from the time of the Mongol conquests and the gradual, but accelerating ways in which connections became ties of inter-dependence. The relations between societies are what will concern us. The forces pulling the world together vary from religious to economic, political to intellectual. These forces bring the world together, but they also create new divisions. Nowadays, we call this \"globalization.\" That term has tended to emphasize the drive to worldwide integration; the view of globalization taken in this course emphasizes disintegration as well as integration. We will tackle some very basic questions: How do we explain the staggering wealth of China in the centuries up to 1750, as well as China's recent ascent?

    sequentially inequality and education, education and social mobility, social
    mobility and wealth distribution, and wealth distribution and regime change.

    of inequality and population behavior, population behavior and human development,
    human development and social organization, and social organization and
    social stratification. Part 3 deals with issues of identification and motivation

    Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer
    language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera.
    To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming
    environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.
    These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical
    and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through
    multiple "mini-projects" in Python. To make this class enjoyable,
    these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack,
    and Asteroids. When youve finished our course, we cant promise
    that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will
    learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while youre doing
    it.""" ;

their knowledge of fundamental chemistry strengthened as they work with
familiar ideas from freshman chemistry (e.g. acids and bases, solubility,
electrochemistry, stoichometry) to solve analysis problems. They
will also be introduced to the instrumentation of analytical chemistry,

Astrobiology addresses compelling questions of wide interest such as: How did life originate on the Earth? Is this an inevitable process and is life common across the Universe? Astrobiology is an interdisciplinary science that bridges fields as diverse as astrophysics, biology, geosciences and chemistry.In this course we will explore what we know about lifes ability to live in extreme environments on the Earth, we will look at different hypotheses for how it originated. We will look at some of the missions to search for life in our own Solar System and on planets orbiting distant stars. We will discuss some of the extreme environments on the Earth that help us understand the limits of life and how life has adapted to cope with extremes. We will explore the possibility of intelligent alien life and some of the implications of its detection.

was John Calvin? Why were his ideas so influential in the 16th century

his theological vision, his acute sense of social and political questions.
We will consider his contribution to culture, how he contributed to shaping
French language, his understanding of the human before God and in society.
The course will address how Calvin sought to transform the city of Geneva
into an idea and an ideal of Christian life, by thinking the meaning of
work and money, but also by creating educational and ecclesiastical institutions
(the Company of Pastors, the Consistory and
the Academy).The course will locate Calvin within the history of religious toleration,
or rather of religious intolerance. We will analyse the fate of Michel
Servet, a learned Spanish man who was condemned for heresy and executed
in Geneva in 1553. With regard to Calvins theology, we will show both
his lasting contribution (especially his understanding of a God in whom
one may trust) as well as the limitations of his thought (for instance
his doctrine of predestination).Towards the end of this introductory course, we will turn our attention
to the history of Calvinism in Europe (France, Germany, the United Provinces,
England) and in various parts of the world (Americas, South Africa and
Asia).""" ;

    dc:description "When you take a digital photo with your phone or transform the image in Photoshop, when you play a video game or watch a movie with digital effects, when you do a web search or make a phone call, you are using technologies that build upon linear algebra. Linear algebra provides concepts that are crucial to many areas of computer science, including graphics, image processing, cryptography, machine learning, computer vision, optimization, graph algorithms, quantum computation, computational biology, information retrieval and web search. Linear algebra in turn is built on two basic elements, the matrix and the vector.In this class, you will learn the concepts and methods of linear algebra, andhow to use themto think about problems arising in computer science. You will write small programs in the programming language Python to implement basic matrix and vector functionality and algorithms, and use these to process real-world data to achieve such tasks as: two-dimensional graphics transformations, face morphing, face detection, image transformations such as blurring and edge detection, image perspective removal, audio and image compression, searching within an image or an audio clip, classification of tumors as malignant or benign, integer factorization, error-correcting codes, secret-sharing, network layout, document classification, and computing Pagerank (Google's ranking method)." ;

1930s and early 1940s and has been a favorite of adolescent enthusiasts
and cult devotees ever since. Recently, it has entered into a process of
transformation, moving from a species of pulp fiction on the margins of
childrens literature to an autonomous genre, one Will Eisner labeled the
graphic novel. This transformation has been noted in such literary venues
as the New York Times and the New Yorker, as well as in an increasing number
of university classrooms and bookstore shelves.Comic books and Graphic Novels presents a survey of the history of American
comics and a review of major graphic novels circulating in the U. S. today.
It is focused on three main points. First, it argues that as comics develop
in concert with, and participate in literary culture, they should be considered
literature. Second, it reasons that such a designation forces us to redefine
our concept of literature itself. Finally, it explore this transformative
literary world by arguing that comics have much to teach us about ourselves.""" ;

    dc:description "This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students." ;

    dc:description "This course is about molecular evolution - the evolution of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules. The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will cover the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: \"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\"), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem.A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (, neighbor joining).Often, the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are investigating. For instance, knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified, uncharacterized, pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle, thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic treebe an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer.Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology).Topics covered:" ;

has impacted the entire workflow of photography (i.e., from how images
are captured, manipulated and collaborated on, and shared).The course begins with a conceptualization ofphotography as drawing
with light and the capturing of light to form images/videos. You
will learn about and understand how the optics and the sensor within a
camera are generalized, as well as learn about and understand how the lighting
and other aspects of the environment are also generalized through computation
to capture novel images.Pre- and post-processing techniques used to manipulate and improve images
will be discussed. Activities in this course are selected to give
you first hand experience with the power of the web and the Internet for
both analyzing and sharing images.This course is interdisciplinary and draws upon concepts and principles
from computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, mathematics
and optics.We look forward to your engagement and participation with both the course
and its discussion forums.Denis Lantsman is the TA for the class. Denis is a graduate of Harvey
Mudd College, and is currently finishing his MS in Machine Learning at
Georgia Tech. He is responsible for managing the coursera site, monitoring
the forums for student feedback, creating the homework assignments and
quizzes, as well as recording weekly tutorials to help students with their
programming.""" ;

enterprise stand out.Regardless of their department, area of work, or expertise, Content Strategy
practitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile
media to interact with their most important constituents with trustable,
actionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic
content they produce enhances the audiences lives anddeepens their
understanding and engagement with the organization.Content Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but it
is done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest,
trustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports.
Often it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditional
journalism under-serves or does not reach at all. Content Strategy is not
advertising, marketing, or public relations. It is different because it
never pursues the persuasive goals that are appropriate in those disciplines.""" ;

Accelerated by the spectacular rise of Apple and IDEO, design thinking offers an approach better suited for dealing with the accelerating pressures for growth and innovation faced by so many firms and their managers today than business traditional analytic methods. But design thinking can remain mysterious for business students and managers interested in introducing this approach into their decision-making processes. Demystifying it is the focus of this course.Though designing as a craft requires years of dedicated education and talent to master, design thinking, as a problem solving approach, does not. In this course, we work with the following model that contains four questions and ten tools:The four sequential questions that take us on a journey through an assessment of current reality (What is?), the envisioning of a new future (What if?), the development of some concepts for new-business opportunities (What wows?), and the testing of some of those in the marketplace (What works?). The process of design thinking begins with data gathering: at the outset of the design process, designers gather a great deal of data on the users they want to create value for. They mostly do this through ethnographic methods like experience mapping, rather than traditional methods like focus groups and surveys. Farther along in the process, designers make their new ideas concrete (in the form of prototypes) and go out and get better data from the real world in a process that is hypothesis-driven. That is, they treat their new ideas as hypotheses to be tested. They surface the assumptions underlying their hypotheses and test them  usually looking for the kind of behavioral metrics that will allow them to iterate their way to improved value propositions.Accompanying the four questions is a set of new tools to help business people achieve the same kind of disciplined approach to innovation and growth that they bring to the rest of their business." ;

    dc:description """Obesity is a common disorder, and in the United
States and many other western countries more than half of the populations are
overweight or obese. The prevalence is increasing dramatically, and the number
of obese individuals worldwide is now projected to reach as much as 1.1 billion
by 2030. Along with the increasing numbers of obese people, the prevalence of
type-2 diabetes is increasing tremendously worldwide due to the westernized
lifestyle. However, the sensitivity of the individual to a westernized
lifestyle and development of diabetes appears to be much dependent on his or
her genetic risk factors.As diabetes is
associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, and thereby accounts
for a large part of the public health care expenses, there is a great interest
in diabetes research to improve knowledge, prevention and treatment of diabetes.This diabetes course will give you the newest state of the art updates on diabetes research in the fields of clinical aspects of diabetes and regulation of insulin
secretion, epidemiology of diabetes, heritability of diabetes, genetic aspects
of diabetes, prevention of diabetes and insulin resistance, molecular insulin
resistance, cellular aspects of diabetes, physiological regulation of blood
glucose, type 1 diabetes and stem cell research in diabetes.Each section will be covered
by world leading professors (to be announced) in the specific areas.""" ;

also look at preparedness on the institutional and government levels.We will look beyond these plans towards the one aspect of survival, which
will enable a person to survive when all planning has failed. Disasters,
by definition, overwhelm all available resources. If all available resources
are gone, only one thing will keep a person alive and that is their attitude.
A persons awareness and attitude, the two are closely linked, allow a person
the means to remain calm, avoid panic, and draw upon resources within and
outside the person to survive when their world has failed. In truth not
everyone survives in extreme circumstances; people die, but, even in death,
attitude, if it cannot save you, provides some degree or comfort.""" ;

aimed at teachers, learning technologists, and people with a general interest
in education who want to deepen their understanding of what it means to teach
and learn in the digital age. The course is about how digital cultures
intersect with learning cultures online, and how our ideas about online
education are shaped through narratives, or big stories, about the
relationship between people and technology. Well explore some of the most
engaging perspectives on digital culture in its popular and academic forms, and
well consider how our practices as teachers and learners are informed by the
difference of the digital. Well look at how learning and literacy is
represented in popular digital-, (or cyber-) culture, and explore how that
connects with the visions and initiatives we are seeing unfold in our
approaches to digital education.This course will not be taught via a
series of video lectures. Rather, a selection of rich resources will be provided
through which you can begin to engage with the themes of the course. While the
teachers will be present in the discussion forums and in various other media
environments, there will be an emphasis on learner-led group formation, and the
use of social media to build personal learning networks and communities of
peers. On this course, you will be invited to think critically and creatively
about e-learning both as a process and as a topic of study; you will be able to
try out new ideas in a supportive environment, and gain fresh perspectives on
your own experiences of teaching and learning.The course assessment will involve you
creating your own digital artefact: something that is designed to be
experienced digitally, on the web. It will be likely to contain a mixture of text,
image, sound, video, links, and can be created in the environment of your
choice. The artefact will be a representation of any of the themes encountered during the course, and youll have
the opportunity to use digital spaces in new ways to present this work. Our
definition of digital artefact is intentionally imprecise to invite
experimentation and creativity: it will be evaluated via guided peer-assessment.This course has been developed collaboratively by a team of experienced teachers and researchers in online education, who run the internationaldistance programme at the University of Edinburgh.""" ;

for the academic reading and writing characteristic of college. Attending
explicitly to disciplinary context, you will learn to read critically, write
effective arguments, understand the writing process, and craft powerful prose
that meets readers expectations. You will gain writing expertise by exploring questions about expertise itself: What factors impact expert achievement? What does it take to succeed? Who determines success? Since personal investment yields better writing, you can select an area of expertise meaningful to you (a hobby, trade, profession, discipline, etc.) for your major writing projects, which will be drafted and revised in sequenced stages: a critical response to an argument about expertise (2pp.); an explication of a visual image (2pp.); a case study of an expert (4pp.) and an Op-Ed (2 pp.). Your writing will be central to the course as we create a seminar/workshop structure with peer response and selected instructor feedback.Two overarching assumptions about academic writing will shape our work: 1) it is transferable; 2) it is learnable. Being an
effective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions and
engaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These skills are useful across
virtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well.
Perhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration
or genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback. This means that, with
practice, dedication, and working with others,can be an effective academic
writer and contribute your ideas to important, ongoing conversations. Let's start now.""" ;

    dc:description "Not so long ago, it was almost guaranteed that you would die of an infectious disease. In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying of an infectious disease before you've reached the tender age of 5 would have been extremely high.Since then, science has come a long way in understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria,Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.After weve covered the basics,we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We'll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We'll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends' friends, and so on. And of course well be talking about vaccination too. Well also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology.And yes, we will be talking about Zombies - not human zombies, but zombie ants whose brains are hijacked by an infectious fungus.And there's one more thing: during the course, we'll be running a massive online epidemic with you, the participants - virtually, of course. We're looking forward to having you join us for an exciting course!" ;

over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control
contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable
through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to
mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations,
epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be
manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that
epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet),
which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.This course will give an introduction to the
fundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that
are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on
mammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the

performers. At the same time, Beethovens music is casually familiar to
millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically
inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture,
yet still represents its summit.This course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas
from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata
and an aspect of Beethovens music exemplified by it. (These might include: the
relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the
critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of
extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in
which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the
character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis

physics is the foundation for much of modern technology, provides the framework
for understanding light and matter from the subatomic to macroscopic domains,
and makes possible the most precise measurements ever made. More than just a theory, it offers a way of
looking at the world that grows richer with experience and practice. Our course will provide some of that practice and teach 
you "tricks of the trade" (not found in textbooks) that will enable you 
to solve quantum-mechanical problems yourself and understand the subject
 at a deeper level.The
basic principles of quantum physics are actually quite simple, but they lead to
astonishing outcomes. Two examples that
we will look at from various perspectives are the prediction of the laser by
Albert Einstein in 1917 and the prediction of antimatter by Paul Dirac in 1928. Both of these predictions came from very
simple arguments in quantum theory, and led to results that transformed science
and society. Another familiar
phenomenon, magnetism, had been known since antiquity, but only with the advent
of quantum physics was it understood how magnets worked, to a degree that made
possible the discovery in the 1980s of ultrastrong rare-earth magnets. However, lasers, antimatter and magnets are
areas of vibrant research, and they are all encountered in the new field of
ultracold atomic physics that will provide much of the material of Exploring
Quantum Physics.Richard
Feynman once said, I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum
mechanics. We say, thats no reason not
to try! What Feynman was referring to are some of the spooky phenomena like quantum entanglement, which are incomprehensible from the standpoint of classical physics. Even though they have been thoroughly tested by experiment, and are even being exploited for applications such as cryptography and logic processing, they still seem so counterintuitive that they give rise to extraordinary ideas such as the many-world theory. Quantum physics combines
a spectacular record of discovery and predictive success, with foundational
perplexities so severe that even Albert Einstein came to believe that it was
wrong. This is what makes it such an
exciting area of science!""" ;

billion years since the Big Bang. More than 80% of matter in the 
Universe is mysterious Dark Matter, which made stars and galaxies to 
form. The newly discovered Higgs-boson became frozen into the Universe a
 trillionth of a second after the Big Bang and brought order to the 
Universe. Yet we still do not know how ordinary matter (atoms) survived
 against total annihilation by Anti-Matter. The expansion of the 
Universe started acceleration about 7 billion years ago and Universe is 
being ripped apart. The culprit is Dark Energy, a mysterious energy 
multiplying in vacuum. I will present evidence behind these startling

you had been alive at the start of the eighteenth century, your material
well-being would have been much the same whichever region of the world you
lived in, and it would almost certainly have been a precarious existence. Go back 300 years before the eighteenth
century, and not much was different. But
come forward 300 years to the present, and we see a startling transformation.Incomes
in some parts of the world have increased more than ten-fold; and now it most
certainly does matter where you live  with income differentials of 50 times
between the worlds richest and poorest countries. What has changed in the past 300 years is the
development and application of new technologies at a pace unprecedented in
human history  the steam engine, electricity and the computer, to name just a
few. With these developments, for those
who have access to them, have come huge gains in living standards.In
this course well explore the spectacular (but uneven) story of economic
development  beginning with the Malthusian era, moving on to the take-off of
growth in the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence in living
standards that followed, and finishing in the present with the Global Financial
Crisis. Well cover the main episodes
and events in the development of the world economy in the past 300 years, and
have something to say about most regions of the world. As well as dealing with what happened, the
course will emphasise what is known about why  and what lessons historical
experience can provide for understanding how some countries today are so rich
yet others remain so poor.Course image: Copyright JL Brown. Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)""" ;

is processed so we can get an adult human from an egg. Then well see that much
of the power of genomics is in comparisons. If I only had your genome there's
not much I could do with it. But if I lined it up against a chimpanzee genome
Id see that they are 98.5% identical. Its that 1.5% difference that we study to
determine what makes a chimp a chimp and a human a human.In the next few years youll be able
to get your genome done for a few hundred dollars, and we will look at the
challenges you might face dealing with this new self-knowledge. We shall

tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some
great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem
to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece
and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it
plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention
to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths.
Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window
on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders
that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining
stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate
these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of
the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature,
religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.""" ;

Finally, the U.S. health care system spends over $8000 per patient per year, nearly double the next highest country. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Over the next decade or more, the Act will dramatically re-structure the American health care system.This course will explore the history and structure of the current American health care system, including the history of and problems with employment-based health insurance, the challenges surrounding access, cost and quality, and the medical malpractice conundrum. The course will then explore the history of health care reform and the challenges that were overcome to achieve health reform in America. Finally, we will delineate the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act improves access and quality, and will control costs.

    dc:description """Computation and simulation are increasingly important in all aspects of
    science and engineering. At the same time writing efficient computer programs
    to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult.
    Even laptops now have 4 or more processors, but using them all to solve
    a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce
    parallelism, and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism.
    Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic,
    computer architecture, and memory hierarchies.Although parallel computing will be covered, this isa class
    on the most advanced techniques for using supercomputers, which these days
    have tens of thousands of processors and cost millions of dollars. Instead,
    the goal is to teach tools that you can use immediately on your own laptop,
    desktop, or a small cluster. Cloud computing will also be discussed, and
    students who don't have a multiprocessor computer of their own will still
    be able to do projects using Amazon Web Services at very low cost.Along the way there will also be discussion of software engineering tools
    such as debuggers, unit testing, Makefiles, and the use of version control
    systems. After all, your time is more valuable than computer time, and
    a program that runs fast is totally useless if it produces the wrong results.High performanceis also an important aspect of high
    performance scientific computing, and so another main theme of the course
    is the use of basic tools and techniques to improve your efficiency as
    a computational scientist.""" ;

We will also explore how developments inthe music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.Rock emerged in the mid 1950s as a blending of mainstream pop, rhythm and blues, and country and western--styles that previouslyhad remained relatively separate. This new style became the music of the emerging youth culture and was often associated with teen rebellion. We will follow the story of how this rowdy first wave of rock and roll (1955-59) was tamed in the early 60s but came roaring back with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and then went psychedelicby the end of the decade." ;

We will also explore how developments inthe music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.Emerging out of the experimental and ambitious years of late-60s psychedelia, rock splintered into a variety of styles in the 1970s as the music business continued to expand. By the end of the decade, punk and disco had challenged the excesses of thehippie aesthetic, as rock became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly. The emergence and rise of MTV transformed pop music and propelled the careers of Michael jackson and Madonna, while heavy metal and hip hop dominated the late 1980s.

joy, rather than frustration. You'll learn several techniques for rapidly
prototyping and evaluating multiple interface alternatives -- and why rapid
prototyping and comparative evaluation are essential to excellent interaction
design. You'll learn how to conduct fieldwork with people to help you get
design ideas. How to make paper prototypes and low-fidelity mock-ups that
are interactive -- and how to use these designs to get feedback from other
stakeholders like your teammates, clients, and users. You'll learn principles
of visual design so that you can effectively organize and present information
with your interfaces. You'll learn principles of perception and cognition
that inform effective interaction design. And you'll learn how to perform
and analyze controlled experiments online. In many cases, we'll use Web
design as the anchoring domain. A lot of the examples will come from the
Web, and we'll talk just a bit about Web technologies in particular. When
we do so, it will be to support the main goal of this course, which is
helping you build human-centered design skills, so that you have the principles
and methods to create excellent interfaces with any technology.""" ;

If you enroll, you'll encounter the evidence for the earliest members of our lineage, as they begin the long pathway to humanity. You'll see how scientists are learning about the diets of ancient people, using microscopic evidence and chemical signatures in ancient teeth. We will explore together the exciting fossil discoveries of the last ten years, which have shaken up our notions of the origin of human culture and our own genus.Genomics has fundamentally transformed the way we understand our evolution, in many ways opening the direct evidence of our history to anyone. The course will teach you how to look inside the genomes of humans, Neandertals and other ancient people.If you have used personal genomics to get your own genotypes, the course will guide you in connectinggeneticsto your ancestry among ancient humans.The course brings a special focus on the rapid evolutionary changes of the last 10,000 years. You'll learn about the consequences of our shift to agriculture, and the ways that people of industrialized nations are still changing today.At the end, we trek forward to anticipate what evolutionary changes may be in store for humanity in the future, using our knowledge of history and scientific understanding to inform our speculations." ;

    connection with others called resonance. Their own levels of emotional
    intelligence allow them to create and nurture these resonant relationships.
    They use their EI as a path to resonant leadership through mindfulness,
    hope, compassion, and playfulness. Unfortunately, most people in leadership
    and helping positions (i.e., doctors, teachers, coaches, etc.) lose their
    effectiveness over time because of the cumulative damage from chronic stress.
    But humans can renew themselves, neurologically, hormonally, and emotionally.Based on decades ofresearch into emotional intelligencecompetencies
    and longitudinal studies of their development, the course will examine
    resonance and developing "resonant leadership" capability,emotional
    intelligence, and the experiences of mindfulness, hope, and compassion.

with in-video quizzes, multiple-choice quiz assignments, automatically-checked
interactive programming exercises, midterm and final exams, a discussion

from Stanford's popular Introduction to Databases course. The material

Class2Go platform.Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by
most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge
fraction of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications
systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software
system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information.
In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other
properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability,
efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level
query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer
science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most
useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.""" ;

    dc:description "The goal of the course is to help you develop a valuable mental ability  a powerful way of thinking that our ancestors have developed over three thousand years.Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics  at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box  a valuable ability in todays world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.The primary audience is first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. They will need mathematical thinking to succeed in their major. Because mathematical thinking is a valuable life skill, however, anyone over the age of 17 could benefit from taking the course." ;

    dc:description "With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge,dedication, and creativity.Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use. Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing.We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process.Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide.After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing boarda very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication.In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen." ;

    digital instruments that make sound and music in direct response to program
    logic. The ChucK language provides precise high-level control over
    time, audio computation, and user interface elements (track pad, joysticks,

    by millions of users throughout the world, and is the backbone of dozens
    of academic programs and laptop orchestras. Learning to program using
    ChucK, through the musical examples provided in this course, will prepare
    students to program in C++, Java, and other languages. There will be special

We will learn to conceive of inequality by asking how race, class, and gender work in tandem. We will address one of the crises of recent sociology -- whether we can actually isolate the effects of social context.

    campaigns, medical research, mining, transportation systems, ... and so
    on, and on, and on... every day more of the world around us is at least
    partly run by computer programs. This means that being able to design programs
    - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming
    a more and more valuable skill.To build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the
    specific programming language and libraries needed, and the more general
    skill of how to design a program.This course presents athat will enable you to approach
    the design of complex programs systematically. The method will work for
    programs in this course as well as hard to design programs you develop
    in the future.Using this method you will learn how to model the information in a problem
    domain, how to structure program data to mirror that information and how
    to further structure the data to lead to a well organized program. You
    will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally
    data driven, from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach.
    The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design, and
    to test your program as you develop it.The course has a two-phase structure. In the first phase we use a simple
    teaching language to cover the core of the design method. The second phase
    consists of parallel tracks, with each track using a different popular
    programming language and focusing on a different kind of problem. This
    will help you bring the design method to whatever language and problem
    domain interests you.""" ;

course will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on
mammalian cells, their constituents and their functions. Biology is moving from molecular to modular.
As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists
of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need
to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that
act as discrete functional systems.
These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal
transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn
these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion,
proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular
and cellular systems? What are the
mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level
thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these
systems?The course will develop multiple lines of
reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads
are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that

This course, orgchem1b, together with its prerequisite, orgchem1a are equivalent to a first-semester organic chemistry course; these courses and the subsequent courses (orgchem2a and orgchem2b) are especially suited for students in agricultural, nutritional and biological sciences, as well as premedical, predental, and preveterinary programs." ;

Students currently pursuing advanced studies in the brain sciences will benefit from this course by learning the fundamentals of functional human neuroanatomy and how neuroscience discovery translates to clinical practice." ;

Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.
Why do models make us better thinkers?
Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.
Here's how the course will work.
For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!""" ;

You google a not-so-famous actor, get linked to a Wikipedia entry listing his recent movies and popular YouTube clips of several of them. You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one, download that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you're on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade, but you don't know if it's the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere. In any case, it costs you $10 per Gigabyte, and you decide to stop watching the movie, and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You're happy with the call quality, but get a little irritated when you see there're no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don't. Take a look at the list of 20 questions below. Each question is selected not just for its relevance to our daily lives, but also for the core concepts in the field of networking illustrated by its answers. This course is about formulating and answering these 20 questions.This course will launch the Grand Challenge Homework (GCH) program. Throughout the course, there will be about 10 open-ended, project-like challenges (in social and technological network engineering) provided to all the enrolled students. Associated with GCH is a Industry and Investor Partners (IIP) program. About 10 leading US companies and venture capitalists in the networking industry have agreed to screen the finalists selected by the teaching staff, and then explore opportunities with the selected students to turn their ideas and prototypes into new products and companies. You pour your creativity and energy in this course, we will help create career-changing opportunities for you.The IIP companies associated with this course range from the world-renowned Bell Labs to a startup founded by the father of DSL, and from Silicon Valley VC's like USVP to university-spinoff specialist firms like Osage Partners." ;

Since I don't want to compromise on quality I hope you will all understand and bear with me. -- Jonathan D. Moreno, Ph.D.Perhaps a man really dies when his brain stops, when he loses the power to take in a new idea. --George OrwellNeuroethics might well be the most rapidly growing area within bioethics; indeed, in some respects neuroethics has grown as an independent field, with its own journals, professional society and institutional centers. This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that (a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications. This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience. Irrespective of their validity, even the claims that modern neuroscience entails the re-examination of complex and sensitive topics like free will, consciousness, identity, and responsibility raises significant ethical issues. As such, neuroethics asks questions that extend beyond the usual umbrella of biomedical ethics. This course will, therefore, consider the new knowledge and ways of learning about the brain from scientific and ethico-legal and social standpoints. We will examine the core themes of neuroethics, including cognitive enhancement, the nature of the self and personhood, neuroimaging and privacy, and the ways that all these themes are brought together in matters affecting national security." ;

perpetual motion machine impossible? These are the kinds of questions which can
be answered with classical mechanics, which was first formulated by Isaac
Newton around 1666. Classical, or Newtonian Mechanics is the oldest branch of
physics, but it will never go out of style.
It remains the foundation of our understanding of the physical world and
is constantly used by engineers and scientists. There is a space probe, called
New Horizons, that is on its way to Pluto right now, and it will arrive on July

    dc:description """In this course,
we will examine the main bodies of economic theory that have been used to guide
economists and policy makers understanding of the macroeconomy. Macroeconomics
is a word derived from the Greek prefix makros, meaning large. It is the study
of economic aggregates, of national and international economies and of the
economic management role played by governments and international organisations.The founder of
modern macroeconomics, the British economist John Maynard Keynes, famously wrote
The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right
and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed,
the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be
quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some
defunct economist. This will be the key theme we explore in the course, the
influence of theory and the way that policy responses to events like recession,
unemployment, inflation and the Global Financial Crisis, reflect that theory.We will cover
important macroeconomic concepts such as the national accounts, unemployment
and inflation, explain how the ideas associated with John Maynard Keynes laid
the foundation for governments active management of the macroeconomy in the
post war era, and examine the intellectual basis for the monetary and fiscal
policy responses to the Global Financial Crisis. Economists approaches to the analysis of
long run economic growth will also be considered. The approach will be
critical. There are few areas of human endeavour that attract so much debate
and disagreement as the management of a modern industrial economy. We will not
shy away from those debates. But what we will do is emphasise the systematic
theorising that underlies the way macroeconomists and policy makers approach
their task. The aim is to enable those who take the course to become informed
analysts of the macroeconomy and of current (and past) macroeconomic policy
debates.""" ;

the discovery of the key components of this molecular machinery and the
mechanisms through which they function.I will also
discuss how apoptosis research can help to develop noveltherapeutics

the field.The course
will cover the following topics:1.
Introduction
to programmed cell death and apoptosis2.
The
BCL-2 family of proteins3.

and important developments in social science since 1970 has been the
"discovery" of a consistent economic logic underlying the great
common law subjects of property, contract, tort and crime, the
thousand-year-old bedrock of the English and American legal systems. Property
and contract provide the institutional
scaffolding that makes free exchange in markets possible, while the liability
systems of tort and crime appear tomimic market exchange in areas of human activity
where free exchange itself, for well-defined reasons, is not possible. This
course seeks to expose this underlying economic logic through the close
investigation of a series of paradigmatic problems and examples in light of
some simple but very powerful economic ideas. The course assumes no prior
background in economics or law, and begins with an introduction to the basic
concepts of property, exchange, efficiency and externality. On this foundation,
specific topics in the law, including property, tortand crime, eminent domain, intellectual property and criminal procedure,are considered. Each group of lectures will
elaborate on a different concrete problem or example to suggest the range of legal issues and questionsto which economic reasoning can be productively applied. The ideas and
modes of analysis developed in the course are not difficult or mysterious, but
the questions of interpretation and policy that they raise about a subjectthat affects everyoneare challenging and

The way we cast our votes, the way our votes are counted, and the way we choose who will lead are increasingly controlled by invisible computer software. Most U.S. states have adopted electronic voting, and countries around the world are starting to collect votes over the Internet. However, computerized voting raises startling security risks that are only beginning to be understood outside the research lab, from voting machine viruses that can silently change votes to the possibility that hackers in foreign countries could steal an election. This course will provide the technical background and public policy foundation that 21st century citizens need to understand the electronic voting debate. You'll learn how electronic voting and Internet voting technologies work, why they're being introduced, and what problems they aim to solve. You'll also learn about the computer- and Internet-security risks these systems face and the serious vulnerabilities that recent research has demonstrated. We'll cover widely used safeguards, checks, and balances  and why they are often inadequate. Finally, we'll see how computer technology has the potential to improve election security, if it's applied intelligently. Along the way, you'll hear stories from the lab and from the trenches on a journey that leads from Mumbai jail cells to the halls of Washington, D.C. You'll come away from this course understanding why you can be confident your own vote will count  or why you should reasonably be skeptical." ;

Therefore, I am now making publicly available an original web course that is used by our own students.

    dc:description """In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for its decades-long
contribution to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and
human rights in Europe. War has become virtually unthinkable in the EU. When
the first steps towards supranational cooperation - primarily targeted at
preventing the rearmament of Germany - were made in the aftermath of World War
Two, the Founding Fathers of the European integration construct could never
have imagined this outcome in their wildest dreams. Over the years, the
supranational cooperation would widen - from the original European Communities
consisting of 6 Member States to the current Union of 27 Members  and deepen 
from the originally almost purely economically inspired Communities to the
current Union with a say in almost all areas of national competence. At the
same time, problems with the Euro have plunged the EU in one of the biggest
crises since its inception. This challenges lawmakers to tackle difficult questions
about the continued existence of the Euro and the future direction of the
European integration project.This course will give the students an insight into the law of the EU, a
vast and fascinating area of law which forms an integral part of the legal
systems of its 27 Member States. The course is divided
into three parts. In the first part, we will pay attention to the creation and the development of the EU, its
institutional structure and functioning, and the specific nature and sources of
EU law. In the second part, we will examine how EU law
impacts on the lives of EU citizens as well as on companies that are
established or provide services in the EU. In the final part, we will tackle Europes common currency crisis,
investigating causes, effects and possible routes out of this existential
crisis of the Union.If you are a student, lawyer, entrepreneur or simply
interested in the EU, itsdevelopment and legal system, this course will
provide you with the foundations.The course is of interest to people both
inside and outside the European Union: EU citizens may learn how to benefit
from the rights contained in EU life; people from other parts of the world may
learn from the EUs specific set-up, its functioning and the legal solutions
being applied in the European context.""" ;

be essential for students in many fields, a base equipping them with tools for

for college credit. But it is a vital part of the for credit course on this
topic being offered at the University of Virginia in the spring semester of
2013. Both the Coursera and the UVA students will use the same online material as
a common foundation for their different learning experiences. This is the material to survey 'what
happened' and the big questions about how to explain so many changes  some of
those questions that start with:
"Why?" (The students in
the UVA course then supplement this online material with a lot of additional
reading, research projects about the histories of particular communities around
the world, in-person tutorials and discussions both with me and with their
graduate teaching assistants, and examinations.)It is tempting to think that if we can just understand the
big patterns, we don't have to get too caught up in the details. In this
course, though, we care about chronology. We care about individuals. Without some
careful attention to sequences of cause and effect, without tracing how big
changes come from the choices made by particular people, history can turn into
just a series of descriptions, a somewhat tiresome recitation of one thing
after another. Not this course. So a big part of what we will do is not only
offer a set of remarkable stories, but also offer you training in how to
analyze a situation andhow to think about problems of explaining change.""" ;

    dc:description """Geoscientists define
a living planet as one with active volcanism. By this definition our Earth is
very much alive, with many eruptions each year and with a far greater number of
active volcanoes that can potentially erupt in any given year.In detail, each eruption is
different. Every volcano is its own physical and chemical system, occurs in its
own geological location, is subjected to its local stress field, and is at its
own stage in evolution in geological time.
External triggers of volcanic eruptions are also believed to play an
important role.Yet powerful generalisations
and models of volcanic eruptions are indeed possible and in fact very useful in
dealing with the consequences of volcanic eruptions.How are such models
constructed? They must rest on a basis of a mechanistic understanding of what
volcanoes are, and what they are doing  not just during eruptions but also in
the events leading up to eruptions, and not just at the Earths surface but
also at depth, where the magma is being prepared for the next eruption.In addition to
field observations of past eruptions, monitoring of signals from magmatic
systems, and computer-based simulation of volcanic eruptions, increasingly,
high pressure and high temperature experiments are employed in order to answer
the question of how volcanic systems work.These controlled laboratory conditions
for experimental volcanology are transforming the study of volcanoes from a
chiefly observational discipline where eruptive mechanisms were developed via
theoretical analysis of such observations, into a fully modern scientific
discipline where such theoretical approaches are either verified or rejected,
by the experimental picture of what is possible and what is not.This course shows you how such experimental insight isobtained and what it tells us about erupting volcanoes.""" ;

events, organizations, and personalities through the twentieth century.Throughout
we will consider issues which have preoccupied historians, social movement
theorists, and historians alike:
developing and sustaining political commitment, assessing the strengths
and weaknesses of various forms of political organization, maximizing influence
and securing long-range objectives. We
will also examine competing definitions of leadership; class, race, and gender
dynamics within the movement; and the cultural dynamics of political organizing
and social change.In the process, we
consider not only how the movement altered the status of African Americans in
the U.S. but the legacy of these struggles as they changed understandings of
citizenship and rights more broadly. Our concern throughout the course will be to
not only understand the historical narrative but also to see how historians
work to make sense of the past.""" ;

The issues of harmonic progression, voice leading, and texture are addressed in addition to relevant compositional concepts such ascommon tones, leading tones, repetition, variation, and elaboration.The course offers presentations, demonstrations, and exercises for self-evaluation. Assessment involves a variety of short compositions in common textures foundduring the 18th and 19th centuries.This course assumes that the student has had exposure to the basic principles of tonalharmony, musicianship, and/or some similar music theory introductory course. Students should befairlycomfortable with roman numeral analysis or, at least, chord symbols and common harmonicprogressions.

In the second four weeks, we will examine issues specific to scientific writing, including: authorship, peer review, the format of an original manuscript, and communicating science for lay audiences. Students will complete editing exercises, write two short papers, and edit each others work.The primary audience is undergraduate science majors, graduate students in scientific disciplines, and professional scientists. Students from non-science disciplines can also benefit from the training provided in the first four weeks (on general principles of effective writing)." ;
