TUDO:The last century ushered in significant progress. Philosophers, scientists, artists, and poets overthrew our understanding of the physical world, of human behavior, of thought and its limits, and of art, creativity, and beauty. Scientific progress improved the way we lived across the world.Yet the last century also brought increased levels of war, tyranny, and genocide.  Man pushed boundaries of good and evil, right and wrong, justice and injustice – and people lost faith in values. Now, thinkers and leaders are reconstructing theories of value and creating institutions to embody them.Join this thought-provoking, broad-sweeping course as it draws intriguing connections between philosophy, art, literature, and history, illuminating our world and our place in it.

TUDO:CS 169.2x is the second half of University of California, Berkeley's semester long course on Software as a Service. In the first half of the course, CS 169.1x, students use Agile development methods to deploy a simple SaaS app in the cloud. In the second half, CS 169.2x, students create more sophisticated apps by adding relationships between models in apps and by enhancing their apps with JavaScript. They also learn about what happens after the apps are deployed to real users, including how to monitor performance, identify and fix common performance problems, and avoid compromising customer data. Finally, students learn how to apply Agile techniques to enhance and refactor legacy code, a critical skill for professional programmers.Other topics covered in CS 169.2x includeHow to form, organize and manage small programming teamsIntroduction to design patterns: what they are and how to recognize opportunities to apply themUsing Rails for more advanced features like third-party authentication and elegantly expressing design patterns that arise frequently in SaaSThere will be three homework assignments: two programming assignments and one assignment about operations/deployment. There will also be several short quizzes.Unlike CS 169.1x, which has been offered multiple times both online and on-campus, CS 169.2x is fresh, new material. Although versions of it have been taught at UC Berkeley, it has evolved significantly between offerings, and this online version is essentially new. This is, therefore, an "alpha" version. A more polished version will offered at a later date.Note:

TUDO:3.091x is a first-year course where chemical principles are explained by examination of the properties of materials. The electronic structure and chemical bonding of materials is related to applications and engineering systems throughout the course. The on-campus version of the course has been taught for over thirty five years and is one of the largest classes at MIT. The class will cover the relationship between electronic structure, chemical bonding, and atomic order, and characterization of atomic arrangements in crystalline and amorphous solids: metals, ceramics, semiconductors, and polymers (including proteins). There will be topical coverage of organic chemistry, solution chemistry, acid-base equilibria, electrochemistry, biochemistry, chemical kinetics, diffusion, and phase diagrams. Examples will be drawn from industrial practice (including the environmental impact of chemical processes), from energy generation and storage (e.g. batteries and fuel cells), and from emerging technologies (e.g. photonic and biomedical devices). For the Spring 2013 class, edX registration and course materials are free.Students will complete weekly concept questions, watch videos and work on interspersed exercises, as well as submit weekly homework. Homework assignments may be submitted multiple times until the deadline. Those who earn a passing grade will get a free honor code certificate from MITx.

TUDO:This is a course for those who are interested in the challenge posed by massive and persistent world poverty, and are hopeful that economists might have something useful to say about this challenge. The questions we will take up include: Is extreme poverty a thing of the past? What is economic life like when living under a dollar per day? Are the poor always hungry?  How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is microfinance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be "nasty, brutish and short"? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene? And many others. At the end of this course, you should have a good sense of the key questions asked by scholars interested in poverty today, and hopefully a few answers as well.

TUDO:About HLS1xHLS1x Copyright, an experimental course offered on edX, explores in depth the law, theory, and practice of copyright. Approximately two thirds of the course focus on the copyright system of the United States; the remainder is devoted to the laws pertaining to copyright and "neighboring rights" in other countries. Considerable attention is devoted to the relationship between copyright law and creative expression in a variety of fields: literature; music; film; photography; graphic art; software; comedy; fashion; and architecture. The course commences on January 28, 2013, and lasts for 12 weeks.Enrollment in the course is limited to 500 participants, who were selected through an application process. When admitting participants, the course organizers sought to create a group that is diverse along many dimensions, including country of residence, age, occupation, educational background, and gender. Applicants had to be at least 13 years old, have a good grasp of the English language, and be willing to devote eight hours per week to learning and discussing the material. Otherwise, however, there are no prerequisites for taking this course. In particular, no legal background is required.Several methods of instruction are used. Participants watch pre-recorded lectures, engage in interactive live webcasts of events in which guest speakers address especially controversial issues, discuss legal problems in online forums, and (most importantly) participate once a week in an 80-minute online seminar. Those seminars are taught by teaching fellows, all of whom are currently students at Harvard Law School.At the conclusion of the course, each participant takes a three-hour exam, designed to assess his or her knowledge of copyright law and policy. Those exams are graded by the teaching fellows. Participants who receive passing grades are to be awarded certificates of completion and provided written assessments of their degree of proficiency.HLS1x Copyright is an experimental course, with four different variants that allow Prof. Fisher and his team to experiment with different combinations of teaching materials and educational technologies. Enrollment for the course is limited because we believe that high-quality legal education depends, at least in part, upon supervised small-group discussions of difficult issues. Fidelity to that principle requires confining the course to the number of participants that can be supervised effectively by our 21 teaching fellows. The limit on the enrollment does not mean, however, that we are not allowing access to the course materials; to the contrary, they are made publicly available.

TUDO:Introduction to Computer Science and Programming6.00x is an introduction to using computation to solve real problems. The course is aimed at students with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire (or at least a need) to understand computational approaches to problem solving. Some of the people taking the course will use it as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many, it will be their first and last computer science course.Since the course will be the only formal computer science course many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth.       The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about       how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, it is not a "computation appreciation" course. It is a challenging       and rigorous course in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.Those who earn a passing grade will get an honor code certificate from MITx. Please see theedX FAQ for more information about certificates.The required textbook for this course isIntroduction to Computation and Programming Using	Python (Spring 2013 edition)The MIT Press is offering MITx students a special price, through      March 22, 2013 only, of $17.50 (a 30% discount).

TUDO:About this courseWhat is it to be human, and how can ancient concepts of the heroic and anti-heroic inform our understanding of the human condition? That question is at the core ofThe Ancient Greek HeroThe classical Greeks' concepts of Heroes and the "heroic" were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course, students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts, in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general.In Greek tradition, a hero was a human, male or female, of the remote past, who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue, as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures, ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans, but on a much larger scale. Further, despite their mortality, heroes, like the gods, were objects of cult worship – a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course.The original sources studied in this course include the HomericIliadOdysseyTales of HoffmanBlade RunnerThe true hero of the course is thelogoslogosUsing modern technology and engaging texts,The Ancient Greek Hero

TUDO:Introduction to StatisticsWe are surrounded by information, much of it numerical, and it is important to know how to make sense of it. Stat2x is an introduction to the fundamental concepts and methods of statistics, the science of drawing conclusions from data.The course is the online equivalent of Statistics 2, a 15-week introductory course taken in Berkeley by about 1,000 students each year. Stat2x is divided into three 5-week components. Stat2.1x is the first of the three.The focus of Stat2.1x is on descriptive statistics.  The goal of descriptive statistics is to summarize and present numerical information in a manner that is illuminating and useful. The course will cover graphical as well as numerical summaries of data, starting with a single variable and progressing to the relation between two variables. Methods will be illustrated with data from a variety of areas in the sciences and humanities.There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout Stat2.1x, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results.

TUDO:Introduction to Computer Science and Programming6.00x is an introduction to using computation to solve real problems. The course is aimed at students with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire (or at least a need) to understand computational approaches to problem solving. Some of the people taking the course will use it as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many, it will be their first and last computer science course.Since the course will be the only formal computer science course many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth.       The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about       how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, it is not a "computation appreciation" course. It is a challenging       and rigorous course in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.Those who earn a passing grade will get an honor code certificate from MITx. Please see theedX FAQ for more information about certificates.- expect the book to take at least 10 days to arrive (North America; rest of the world may take longer).

TUDO:Quantitative Methods in Clinical and Public Health Research is the online adaptation of material from the Harvard School of Public Health's classes in epidemiology and biostatistics.Principled investigations to monitor and thus improve the health of individuals are firmly based on a sound understanding of modern quantitative methods. This involves the ability to discover patterns and extract knowledge from health data on a sample of individuals and then to infer, with measured uncertainty, the unobserved population characteristics. This course will address this need by covering the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research. These include outcomes measurement, measures of associations between outcomes and their determinants, study design options, bias and confounding, probability and diagnostic tests, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, power and sample size determinations, life tables and survival methods,  regression methods (both, linear and logistic), and sample survey techniques. Students will analyze sample data sets to acquire knowledge of appropriate computer software. By the end of the course the successful student should have attained a sound understanding of these methods and a solid foundation for further study.

TUDO:Quantum Mechanics and Quantum ComputationQuantum computation is a remarkable subject based on one of the great computational discoveries that computers based on quantum mechanics are exponentially powerful. This course aims to make this cutting-edge material broadly accessible to undergraduate students, including computer science majors who do not have any prior exposure to quantum mechanics. The course starts with a simple introduction to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics using the concepts of qubits (or quantum bits) and quantum gates. This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject, including entanglement, non-local correlations, the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms, including the quantum fourier transform, period finding, Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring integers, as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems.

TUDO:Globalization is a fascinating spectacle that can be understood as global systems of competition and connectivity.  These man-made systems provide transport, communication, governance, and entertainment on a global scale. International crime networks are outgrowths of the same systems. Topics include national identity, language diversity, the global labor market, popular culture, sports and climate change.However, an increase in integration has not brought increased equality.  Globalization creates winners and losers among countries and global corporations, making competition the beating heart of the globalization process.The globalization process exemplifies connectivity. Globalization is unimaginable without the unprecedented electronic networks that project dominant cultural products into every society on earth.Learn how to identify and analyze global systems and better understand how the world works.

TUDO:Introduction to Statistics: ProbabilityStatistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1000 students each year. Stat2.2x is the second of three five-week courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2.The focus of Stat2.2x is on probability theory: exactly what is a random sample, and how does randomness work? If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1, does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10? What is the law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population? What should you expect to happen "just by chance"? These are some of the questions we will address in the course.We will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples, discuss the factors that affect their accuracy, and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions.Be warned: by the end of Stat2.2x you will not want to gamble. Ever. (Unless you're really good at counting cards, in which case you could try blackjack, but perhaps after taking all these edX courses you'll find other ways of earning money.)As Stat2.2x is part of a series, the basic prerequisites are the same as those for Stat2.1x: high school arithmetic and good comprehension of English. In addition, you are expected to know the material of Stat2.1x, with particular emphasis on histograms, averages, SDs, and the normal curve.The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results.

TUDO:Science & Cooking brings together top chefs and preeminent Harvard researchers to explore how everyday cooking and haute cuisine can illuminate basic principles in physics and engineering, and vice versa.During each week of the course, you will watch as chefs reveal the secrets behind some of their most famous culinary creations — often right in their own restaurants. Inspired by such cooking mastery, the Harvard team will then explain, in simple and sophisticated ways, the science behind the recipe.Topics will include: soft matter materials, such as emulsions, illustrated by aioli; elasticity, exemplified by the done-ness of a steak; and diffusion, revealed by the phenomenon of spherification, the culinary technique pioneered by Ferran Adrià.To help you make the link between cooking and science, an “equation of the week” will capture the core scientific concept being explored. You will also have the opportunity to be an experimental scientist in your very own laboratory — your kitchen. By following along with the engaging recipe of the week, taking measurements, and making observations, you will learn to think both like a cook and a scientist. The lab is also one of the most unique components of this course — after all, in what other science course do you get to eat your lab?
