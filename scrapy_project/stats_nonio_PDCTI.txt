Information and communication technologies (ICT) role in education and training has increased in the last few years. Education methodologies and materials have also been influenced by technology. Terms like e-learning, b-learning and m-learning are common today. Technology has been used to support learning in many areas and in all levels of education. The group of professors responsible for this course has been developing research in several sub-areas, such as the utilization of computer based systems to support computer-science learning, the design and development of educational simulations and the utilization of mobile devices to support learning. Some of this research was developed in collaboration with researchers from other areas, namely Education, and from other institutions from Portugal and abroad. In this perspective it is possible the participation of researchers from other institutions in some course modules. Technology and Learning main objective is to allow students to deepen their knowledge in the field of ICT applied to Education and Training, preparing them to do research in this area.

The goal of this course is to introduce the students principles of empirical research based on quantitative methods as well as to improve their research communication skills, both orally and in writing. The course is split into two modules: Quantitative Methods (QM) and Scientific Communication (SC). QM: The goal of this course is to introduce the students to a wide range of tools and techniques that will help them to conduct sound empirical and quantitative research. It will cover topics of exploratory data analysis, inferential statistics, and experimental design. Special emphasis will be given to techniques that allow a comprehensive interpretation of data, generalization from sampled data and sound ways of designing experiments. SC: This course aims to develop students’ skills in scientific communication, oral and written, and will include both active and passive components. The focus will be on achieving clarity, concision, coherence/cohesion and an appropriate style in specific academic/scientific text types.
