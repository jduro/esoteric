title: Fantasy and Science Fiction: The Human Mind, Our Modern World
objectives: Fantasy is a key term both in psychology and in the art and artifice of humanity. The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, and often shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale to kiddie lit to myth; from "Cinderella" toto; from building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole societies. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent needs and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself in many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy godmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical viewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction, fromto, is the most important in our modern world because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound ways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind, shape not only our world but our very hopes and fears. This course will explore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art and as insights into ourselves and our world.For further information about the coursework, please see thepage.

experience show that the cybercrime scene is becoming increasingly organized
and consolidated, with strong links also to traditional criminal networks.
Modern attacks are indeed stealthy and often profit oriented.Malicious software (malware) is the traditional way in which cybercriminals infect user
and enterprise hosts to gain access to their private, financial, and
intellectual property data. Once stolen, such information can enable more
sophisticated attacks, generate illegal revenue, and allow for cyber-espionage.By mixing a practical, hands-on approach with the theory and techniques behind the scene, the course discusses the current academic and underground research in the
field, trying to answer the foremost question about malware and underground
economy, namely, "Should we care?".Students will learn how traditional and mobile malware work, how they are analyzed and
detected, peering through the underground ecosystem that drives this profitable
but illegal business.

about the role and practice of archaeology in the world today. If archaeologists
are trained to investigate the past, what is left for us to study? Who gets to be an archaeologist? How and why do archaeologists hunt for
treasures, and what do we do once weve discovered them? Who pays for archaeological work? When did archaeology begin? What can we know, and not know, about people
in the past? What do archaeologists know
about the past that most people would never guess  and why arent we telling
you? What is an archaeologists greatest
fear? Why are people entirely willing to
murder each other over the fate of archaeological sites? Are Real Men alone capable of discovering the
truth behind all this?
prereq: Absolutely no prerequisites. Just be curious.
summary: Admit it  you wanted to be an archaeologist when you grew up...  This course builds on that enthusiasm, while radically expanding your notions about just what archaeology is and just what archaeologists do.

title: Social Epidemiology
objectives: This course is about understanding the determinants of health from a broad
perspective. We focus on how social relationships and institutions -- such
as familial relationships, national policies, and global economic forces
-- promote or undermine the health of populations. The course covers existing
evidence of health disparities, research methods, and theories relevant
to the topic.The course is interesting because it reveals the so-called fundamental
causes of disease and health disparities recognizable within social groups.
For example, we examine why a flu germ can affect whole groups of people
differently. In short, the course challenges the notion that health is
a narrowly defined medical problem.Students in the course will listen to lectures, read provided materials,
and complete quizzes and tests that examine comprehension and one's ability
to synthesize ideas.

of an event) and computer system organization (such as binary representations
and arithmetic). You should be comfortable with simple calculations and
manipulations using scientific notation. We teach the course at the upper-undergraduate
level. To do the optional, hands-on exercises you should be comfortable
with installing systems software and running command-line programs.
summary: The Internet is a computer network that millions of people use every day. Understand the design strategies used to solve computer networking problems while you learn how the Internet works.
title: Archaeology's Dirty Little Secrets
objectives: In this class, we will ask and answer a series of questions
about the role and practice of archaeology in the world today. If archaeologists
are trained to investigate the past, what is left for us to study? Who gets to be an archaeologist? How and why do archaeologists hunt for
treasures, and what do we do once weve discovered them? Who pays for archaeological work? When did archaeology begin? What can we know, and not know, about people
in the past? What do archaeologists know
about the past that most people would never guess  and why arent we telling
you? What is an archaeologists greatest
fear? Why are people entirely willing to
murder each other over the fate of archaeological sites? Are Real Men alone capable of discovering the
truth behind all this?
prereq: Absolutely no prerequisites. Just be curious.
summary: Admit it  you wanted to be an archaeologist when you grew up...  This course builds on that enthusiasm, while radically expanding your notions about just what archaeology is and just what archaeologists do. 
 
title: Social Epidemiology
objectives: This course is about understanding the determinants of health from a broad
perspective. We focus on how social relationships and institutions -- such
as familial relationships, national policies, and global economic forces
-- promote or undermine the health of populations. The course covers existing
evidence of health disparities, research methods, and theories relevant
to the topic.The course is interesting because it reveals the so-called fundamental
causes of disease and health disparities recognizable within social groups.
For example, we examine why a flu germ can affect whole groups of people
differently. In short, the course challenges the notion that health is
a narrowly defined medical problem.Students in the course will listen to lectures, read provided materials,
and complete quizzes and tests that examine comprehension and one's ability
to synthesize ideas.
prereq: Students should be curious, enthusiasticreaders, with undergraduate-levelanalytical
and critical thinkingskills; andhave an interest inpolicy
implications surrounding social and societalhealth issues. A basic
understanding of statistics would also beuseful.
summary: Social epidemiology is about how a society makes people sick and/or healthy. We address not only the identification of new disease risk factors (e.g., deficient social capital) but also how well-known exposures (e.g., cigarette smoking, lead paint, health insurance) emerge and are maintained by the social system.
title: Health for All Through Primary Health Care
objectives: Two of the most inspiring, least understood, and most often derided terms
in global health discourse are Health for All and Primary Health Care.
In this course, we will explore these terms in the context of global health,
their origins and meanings, the principles upon which they rest, and examples
of how these principles have been implemented both at small scale as well
as at large scale. We will also explore some ultra-low-cost approaches
to Health for All through primary health care and the promise that primary
health care holds for eventually achieving Health for All.The course consists of six one-hour lectures with readings and opportunities
for discussions among those taking the course and interactions with the
professor.
prereq: 
summary: This course explores why primary health care is central for achieving Health for All. It provides examples of how primary health care has been instrumental in approaching this goal in selected populations and how the principles of primary health care can guide future policies and actions.

title: Disaster Preparedness
objectives: This course will teach the student how to survive when everything we normally
take for granted is gone, when the structures we depend on have failed.
We will examine the Disaster Cycle, particularly the Mitigation and Recovery
phases. Students will prepare an extensive personal preparedness plan covering
such topics as supplies, communication, food and water, shelter, security,
and comfort (yes even in survival there can and should be comfort). We
also look at preparedness on the institutional and government levels.We will look beyond these plans towards the one aspect of survival, which
will enable a person to survive when all planning has failed. Disasters,
by definition, overwhelm all available resources. If all available resources
are gone, only one thing will keep a person alive and that is their attitude.
A persons awareness and attitude, the two are closely linked, allow a person
the means to remain calm, avoid panic, and draw upon resources within and
outside the person to survive when their world has failed. In truth not
everyone survives in extreme circumstances; people die, but, even in death,
attitude, if it cannot save you, provides some degree or comfort.
prereq: No specific background is required, all with a willingness to participate
and learn are welcome.
summary: During this course, students will gain an understanding of the Disaster Cycle, concentrating on the Mitigation Phase. They will examine disaster planning on a personal level developing a disaster plan and examine Awareness and Attitude during disasters and daily life.

title: Grow to Greatness: Smart Growth for Private Businesses, Part I
objectives: Most entrepreneurship courses focus on how to start a business. Few focus on the next big entrepreneurial inflection point: how do you successfully grow an existing private business? This is the focus of this Course. It is based on the instructor's research and thirty years of real-world experience advising private growth companies.This Course will challenge how you think about growth; give you tools to help you plan for growth, assess the preconditions to grow, and manage the risks of growth. You will study stories of how five different private businesses faced their growth challenges.Growth, if not properly managed, can overwhelm a business, destroying value and in many cases even causing the business to fail. However, the research shows that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from others' experienceyou do not have to "reinvent the wheel".The Course format is case based. Each case tells a compelling story. You will learn from Julie Allinson, Susan Fellers, Dave Lindsey, Parik Laxinarayan and Eric Barger. In addition, each week, we will discuss a different content theme. In Weeks and 2 and 5, you will engage in Workshops where you will be asked to use and apply the Course tools and concepts to create growth strategies for two different real-life businesses. You will have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow-students to learn from each other as the Course progresses.You will learn about the: "3 Myths of Growth"; the "Truth About Growth"; why growth is like "Mother Nature"; the "Gas Pedal" approach to growth; the all important "4 Ps" of how to grow; and how to scale a business strategically.
prereq: The only prerequisite for this Course is an interest in learning about how privately-owned entrepreneurial businesses grow. The following people will find this course helpful: students at all levels, private business owners, managers of private businesses, employees of private businesses, and people interested in growth, economic development, and job creation.

objectives: This course covers our evolutionary history across more than seven million years, from our origins among the apes up to the biological changes that are still unfolding today. If you enroll, you'll encounter the evidence for the earliest members of our lineage, as they begin the long pathway to humanity. You'll see how scientists are learning about the diets of ancient people, using microscopic evidence and chemical signatures in ancient teeth. We will explore together the exciting fossil discoveries of the last ten years, which have shaken up our notions of the origin of human culture and our own genus.Genomics has fundamentally transformed the way we understand our evolution, in many ways opening the direct evidence of our history to anyone. The course will teach you how to look inside the genomes of humans, Neandertals and other ancient people.If you have used personal genomics to get your own genotypes, the course will guide you in connectinggeneticsto your ancestry among ancient humans.The course brings a special focus on the rapid evolutionary changes of the last 10,000 years. You'll learn about the consequences of our shift to agriculture, and the ways that people of industrialized nations are still changing today.At the end, we trek forward to anticipate what evolutionary changes may be in store for humanity in the future, using our knowledge of history and scientific understanding to inform our speculations.
prereq: The materials are designed to guide students on their own distinctive paths of discovery. Short documentary videos highlight the most up-to-date science and bring students virtually into some of the most famous archaeological sites. With a series of interviews, students will hear about new ideas from many of the world's leading experts. Students who are experimenting with the world of personal genomics can see how their own genetic results fit into global and historical patterns. And together students will build and test scenarios of how human evolution may continue in the future.

title: Design Thinking for Business Innovation
objectives: Design thinking is a popular new idea in the business world. Accelerated by the spectacular rise of Apple and IDEO, design thinking offers an approach better suited for dealing with the accelerating pressures for growth and innovation faced by so many firms and their managers today than business traditional analytic methods. But design thinking can remain mysterious for business students and managers interested in introducing this approach into their decision-making processes. Demystifying it is the focus of this course.Though designing as a craft requires years of dedicated education and talent to master, design thinking, as a problem solving approach, does not. In this course, we work with the following model that contains four questions and ten tools:The four sequential questions that take us on a journey through an assessment of current reality (What is?), the envisioning of a new future (What if?), the development of some concepts for new-business opportunities (What wows?), and the testing of some of those in the marketplace (What works?). The process of design thinking begins with data gathering: at the outset of the design process, designers gather a great deal of data on the users they want to create value for. They mostly do this through ethnographic methods like experience mapping, rather than traditional methods like focus groups and surveys. Farther along in the process, designers make their new ideas concrete (in the form of prototypes) and go out and get better data from the real world in a process that is hypothesis-driven. That is, they treat their new ideas as hypotheses to be tested. They surface the assumptions underlying their hypotheses and test them  usually looking for the kind of behavioral metrics that will allow them to iterate their way to improved value propositions.Accompanying the four questions is a set of new tools to help business people achieve the same kind of disciplined approach to innovation and growth that they bring to the rest of their business.
prereq: Anyone interested in innovation in an organizational context would benefit from this class.
summary: This course provides an overview of the process and tools used for design thinking, and examines their application in business situations.

objectives: Designed for students who are thinking of a career in
management or consulting, this course brings the methodology and critical
apparatus of the humanities into the field of management to fulfill two basic
objectives. The first objective is to place in broad critical perspective how
we think about the function and culture of management and to expand the
boundaries of how managers understand their role within a firm, how they take
decisions, set priorities and benchmark success and failure. The second objective
is to help students learn how to build robust analytical frameworks informed by
different perspectives in order to evaluate concepts and solve problems.
prereq: No background
is required;
summary: Innovative management and inspired leadership need more than rules and knowledge: imagination, creativity and lateral thinking are also integral.

title: Epidemics - the Dynamics of Infectious Diseases
objectives: Not so long ago, it was almost guaranteed that you would die of an infectious disease. In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying of an infectious disease before you've reached the tender age of 5 would have been extremely high.Since then, science has come a long way in understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria,Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.After weve covered the basics,we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We'll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We'll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends' friends, and so on. And of course well be talking about vaccination too. Well also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology.And yes, we will be talking about Zombies - not human zombies, but zombie ants whose brains are hijacked by an infectious fungus.And there's one more thing: during the course, we'll be running a massive online epidemic with you, the participants - virtually, of course. We're looking forward to having you join us for an exciting course!
prereq: No background is required; all are welcome.
summary: Malaria, HIV/AIDS, Influenza, Measles - were in a constant battle against infectious diseases. This is a course about the dynamics of such diseases  - how they emerge, how they spread around the globe, and how they can best be controlled.

    that work at a global scale, contexts are changing.This course is designed to help students better understand the complex
    and rapidly changing nature of higher education and research in a globalizing
    era. A complementary objective is to experiment with the MOOC platform
    and assess how well it works to support international collaborative teaching
    and service. We decided to participate in this initiative to engage in
    some learning while doing that will build on our experiences in international
    collaborative research, advising, and teaching, as well as Kris experience
    at UW-Madison with a relative new online course (Geography 340  World
    Regions in Global Context).Professors Olds and Robertson began collaborating via a Worldwide Universities
    Network (WUN) exchange scheme in the mid-2000s. The University of Bristol
    and University of Wisconsin-Madison are both members of the WUN. We very
    much look forward to engaging with you about this topic.
prereq: 
summary: This course is designed to examine an array of issues related to the globalization of higher education and research. The main objective of the course is to enable students to better understand how and why universities are engaged in the globalization process, as well as what the key implications of this development process are.

title: Grow to Greatness: Smart Growth for Private Businesses, Part I
objectives: Most entrepreneurship courses focus on how to start a business. Few focus on the next big entrepreneurial inflection point: how do you successfully grow an existing private business? This is the focus of this Course. It is based on the instructor's research and thirty years of real-world experience advising private growth companies.This Course will challenge how you think about growth; give you tools to help you plan for growth, assess the preconditions to grow, and manage the risks of growth. You will study stories of how five different private businesses faced their growth challenges.Growth, if not properly managed, can overwhelm a business, destroying value and in many cases even causing the business to fail. However, the research shows that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from others' experienceyou do not have to "reinvent the wheel".The Course format is case based. Each case tells a compelling story. You will learn from Julie Allinson, Susan Fellers, Dave Lindsey, Parik Laxinarayan and Eric Barger. In addition, each week, we will discuss a different content theme. In Weeks and 2 and 5, you will engage in Workshops where you will be asked to use and apply the Course tools and concepts to create growth strategies for two different real-life businesses. You will have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow-students to learn from each other as the Course progresses.You will learn about the: "3 Myths of Growth"; the "Truth About Growth"; why growth is like "Mother Nature"; the "Gas Pedal" approach to growth; the all important "4 Ps" of how to grow; and how to scale a business strategically.
prereq: The only prerequisite for this Course is an interest in learning about how privately-owned entrepreneurial businesses grow. The following people will find this course helpful: students at all levels, private business owners, managers of private businesses, employees of private businesses, and people interested in growth, economic development, and job creation.
summary: This course focuses on the common growth challenges faced by existing private businesses when they attempt to grow substantially.
title: Artificial Intelligence Planning
objectives: Planning is a fundamental part of intelligent systems. In this course, for example, you will learn the basic algorithms that are used in robots to deliberate over a course of actions to take. Simpler, reactive robots don't need this, but if a robot is to act intelligently, this type of reasoning about actions is vital.
prereq: The course is at an introductory level, but you will need a basic understanding of logic. Optional programming assignments require programming skills.
summary: The course aims to provide a foundation in artificial intelligence techniques for planning, with an overview of the wide spectrum of different problems and approaches, including their underlying theory and their applications.
title: Introduction to Genetics and Evolution
objectives: Introduction to Genetics and Evolution gives interested people a very basic overview of the principles behind these very fundamental areas of biology. We often hear about new "genome sequences," commercial kits that can tell you about your ancestry (including pre-human) from your DNA or disease predispositions, debates about the truth of evolution, and why animals behave the way they do. This course provides the basic biology you need to understand all of these issues better and tries to clarify some misconceptions. No prior coursework is assumed.
prereq: No prior coursework in the subject is assumed. It would be helpful for the application of some concepts to have a working knowledge of High School level math, including basic algebra. While useful for solving the assigned problems, this is not essential to understand and follow the general concepts and otherwise enjoy the class.
summary: A whirlwind introduction to evolution and genetics, from basic principles to current applications, including how disease genes are mapped and how we leverage evolutionary concepts to aid humanity.
title: Write Like Mozart: An Introduction to Classical Music Composition
objectives: This course aims to give students a set of approaches for composition in the style of Classical and Romantic era European art music. The principles and skills in this course engage one asmuch as possible in the thinking of composers from those eras, giving the student compositionalfreedoms that composers of that era enjoyed. The issues of harmonic progression, voice leading, and texture are addressed in addition to relevant compositional concepts such ascommon tones, leading tones, repetition, variation, and elaboration.The course offers presentations, demonstrations, and exercises for self-evaluation. Assessment involves a variety of short compositions in common textures foundduring the 18th and 19th centuries.This course assumes that the student has had exposure to the basic principles of tonalharmony, musicianship, and/or some similar music theory introductory course. Students should befairlycomfortable with roman numeral analysis or, at least, chord symbols and common harmonicprogressions. This course is not aimed exclusively at musicians with a classical musicbackground. Rock, pop, and jazz musicians might find this course interesting as a stylisticcontrast to the genres they usually work in.
prereq: 
summary: This course introduces students to strategies for style writing of common practice European art music.  The issues of harmonic progression, voice leading, and texture are addressed in addition to relevant compositional concepts like repetition, variation, and elaboration.  The course aims to offer a creative space even within the restrictions of stylistic emulation.

prereq: 
summary: This cross-disciplinary course deals with the undetermined, the unpredictable- or what appears to be such. Learn about the usefulness of randomness in communication and computation, the intrinsic randomness of quantum phenomena, the unpredictability of the weather, the role of chance in evolution, and the implications of the neural activity of the brain on our "free will".
title: Human Evolution: Past and Future
objectives: This course covers our evolutionary history across more than seven million years, from our origins among the apes up to the biological changes that are still unfolding today. If you enroll, you'll encounter the evidence for the earliest members of our lineage, as they begin the long pathway to humanity. You'll see how scientists are learning about the diets of ancient people, using microscopic evidence and chemical signatures in ancient teeth. We will explore together the exciting fossil discoveries of the last ten years, which have shaken up our notions of the origin of human culture and our own genus.Genomics has fundamentally transformed the way we understand our evolution, in many ways opening the direct evidence of our history to anyone. The course will teach you how to look inside the genomes of humans, Neandertals and other ancient people.If you have used personal genomics to get your own genotypes, the course will guide you in connectinggeneticsto your ancestry among ancient humans.The course brings a special focus on the rapid evolutionary changes of the last 10,000 years. You'll learn about the consequences of our shift to agriculture, and the ways that people of industrialized nations are still changing today.At the end, we trek forward to anticipate what evolutionary changes may be in store for humanity in the future, using our knowledge of history and scientific understanding to inform our speculations.
prereq: The materials are designed to guide students on their own distinctive paths of discovery. Short documentary videos highlight the most up-to-date science and bring students virtually into some of the most famous archaeological sites. With a series of interviews, students will hear about new ideas from many of the world's leading experts. Students who are experimenting with the world of personal genomics can see how their own genetic results fit into global and historical patterns. And together students will build and test scenarios of how human evolution may continue in the future.
summary: Introduction to the science of human origins, the fossil and archaeological record, and genetic ancestry of living and ancient human populations. The course emphasizes the ways our evolution touches our lives, including health and diet, and explores how deep history may shape the future of our species.
title: Initiation  la thorie des distributions
objectives: Dans plusieurs domaines des sciences (physique, mcanique, analyse numrique, etc.) apparat la ncessit de dvelopper un calcul diffrentiel "gnralis" pour des fonctions peu rgulires, par exemple discontinues. La premire leon prsente une situation de ce genre. L'objet de ce cours est d'introduire la thorie des distributions qui fournit une rponse lgante  ce problme.Dans un premier temps, nous prsentons la notion de distribution, gnralisant la notion de fonction, et les premires proprits de ces objets mathmatiques.On montre ensuite comment certaines oprations bien connues sur les fonctions, en particulier la drivation, se prolongent naturellement au cadre des distributions.Le cours s'achve sur quelques applications  des exemples classiques d'quations aux drives partielles linaires.
prereq: Calcul diffrentiel  plusieurs variables.Notions lmentaires de topologie.Connaissance de l'intgrale de Lebesgue.
summary: Une fonction discontinue peut-elle tre solution d'une quation diffrentielle? Comment dfinir rigoureusement la masse de Dirac (une "fonction" d'intgrale un, nulle partout sauf en un point) et ses drives? Peut-on dfinir une notion de "drive d'ordre fractionnaire"?  Cette initiation aux distributions rpond  ces questions - et  bien d'autres.
title: Design Thinking for Business Innovation
objectives: Design thinking is a popular new idea in the business world. Accelerated by the spectacular rise of Apple and IDEO, design thinking offers an approach better suited for dealing with the accelerating pressures for growth and innovation faced by so many firms and their managers today than business traditional analytic methods. But design thinking can remain mysterious for business students and managers interested in introducing this approach into their decision-making processes. Demystifying it is the focus of this course.Though designing as a craft requires years of dedicated education and talent to master, design thinking, as a problem solving approach, does not. In this course, we work with the following model that contains four questions and ten tools:The four sequential questions that take us on a journey through an assessment of current reality (What is?), the envisioning of a new future (What if?), the development of some concepts for new-business opportunities (What wows?), and the testing of some of those in the marketplace (What works?). The process of design thinking begins with data gathering: at the outset of the design process, designers gather a great deal of data on the users they want to create value for. They mostly do this through ethnographic methods like experience mapping, rather than traditional methods like focus groups and surveys. Farther along in the process, designers make their new ideas concrete (in the form of prototypes) and go out and get better data from the real world in a process that is hypothesis-driven. That is, they treat their new ideas as hypotheses to be tested. They surface the assumptions underlying their hypotheses and test them  usually looking for the kind of behavioral metrics that will allow them to iterate their way to improved value propositions.Accompanying the four questions is a set of new tools to help business people achieve the same kind of disciplined approach to innovation and growth that they bring to the rest of their business.
prereq: Anyone interested in innovation in an organizational context would benefit from this class.
summary: This course provides an overview of the process and tools used for design thinking, and examines their application in business situations.


title: Clinical Terminology for International and American Students
objectives: The language of the American clinical setting has many unique terms, abbreviations
and acronyms. Sudden exposure to this new language is challenging for both
American students and international students coming to the United States
to begin or continue their studies in the health professions. This course
provides strategies for learning the terms, abbreviations and acronyms
that are used commonly in the technical language of the clinical unit.
Self-pacing and self-assessment are encouraged. Students will be encouraged
to use an on-line clinical dictionary focused on those terms, abbreviations,
and acronyms that commonly challenge students who are new to American clinical
settings.
prereq: This course is for International and American undergraduate or graduate
students in the health professions who will be receiving clinical practice
education in the United States.
summary: This course is for International and American undergraduate or graduate students in the health professions who are planning or currently beginning clinical practice education in the United States.
title: Critical Perspectives on Management
objectives: Designed for students who are thinking of a career in
management or consulting, this course brings the methodology and critical
apparatus of the humanities into the field of management to fulfill two basic
objectives. The first objective is to place in broad critical perspective how
we think about the function and culture of management and to expand the
boundaries of how managers understand their role within a firm, how they take
decisions, set priorities and benchmark success and failure. The second objective
is to help students learn how to build robust analytical frameworks informed by
different perspectives in order to evaluate concepts and solve problems.
prereq: No background
is required;
summary: Innovative management and inspired leadership need more than rules and knowledge: imagination, creativity and lateral thinking are also integral. This class offers students the opportunity  to consider different ways to ask questions, ponder problems, discover opportunities and explore key concepts that inform the contemporary practice of management.

summary: Ce cours introduit le concept de Probabilit, dont la puissance permet de modliser d'innombrables situations o le hasard intervient. Il est bas sur le livre de Sylvie Mlard "Alatoire : introduction  la thorie et au calcul des probabilits" qui rsulte lui-mme du cours de tronc commun de premire anne de l'cole polytechnique.
title: Epidemics - the Dynamics of Infectious Diseases
objectives: Not so long ago, it was almost guaranteed that you would die of an infectious disease. In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying of an infectious disease before you've reached the tender age of 5 would have been extremely high.Since then, science has come a long way in understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria,Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.After weve covered the basics,we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We'll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We'll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends' friends, and so on. And of course well be talking about vaccination too. Well also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology.And yes, we will be talking about Zombies - not human zombies, but zombie ants whose brains are hijacked by an infectious fungus.And there's one more thing: during the course, we'll be running a massive online epidemic with you, the participants - virtually, of course. We're looking forward to having you join us for an exciting course!
prereq: No background is required; all are welcome.
summary: Malaria, HIV/AIDS, Influenza, Measles - were in a constant battle against infectious diseases. This is a course about the dynamics of such diseases  - how they emerge, how they spread around the globe, and how they can best be controlled.

title: The Ancient Greeks
objectives: This course is a survey of ancient Greek history, covering the roughly
13 centuries that extended from the Minoan / Mycenaean Bronze Age (ca.
1800-1200 BCE) down to the death of Socrates in 399 BCE. Along with
studying the most important events and personalities, we will consider
broader issues such as political and cultural values and methods of historical
interpretation.Some of the topics we will cover include: relations between the Greeks
and their neighbors to the East; Homer and the heroic ideal; the development
of the type of community called the "polis"; the diffusion of Greek civilization
from Southern Italy to the shores of the Black Sea; gods and mortals in
myth, religion and ritual; the roles of women; Athenian drama; the treatment
of slaves and foreigners; and the birth and evolution of democracy. We
will strive to get as full an understanding as we can of this extraordinary,
and extraordinarily influential, society.Almost all the reading assignments are from ancient sources in translation.
No previous knowledge of ancient history is assumed.
prereq: This course is suitable for advanced high school students, college and
university undergraduates, and anyone who is interested in history. As
noted above, you do not have to have prior knowledge of ancient history.
To put it another way, all are welcome.

title: Property and Liability: An Introduction to Law and Economics
objectives: One of the most interesting
and important developments in social science since 1970 has been the
"discovery" of a consistent economic logic underlying the great
common law subjects of property, contract, tort and crime, the
thousand-year-old bedrock of the English and American legal systems. Property
and contract provide the institutional
scaffolding that makes free exchange in markets possible, while the liability
systems of tort and crime appear tomimic market exchange in areas of human activity
where free exchange itself, for well-defined reasons, is not possible. This
course seeks to expose this underlying economic logic through the close
investigation of a series of paradigmatic problems and examples in light of
some simple but very powerful economic ideas. The course assumes no prior
background in economics or law, and begins with an introduction to the basic
concepts of property, exchange, efficiency and externality. On this foundation,
specific topics in the law, including property, tortand crime, eminent domain, intellectual property and criminal procedure,are considered. Each group of lectures will
elaborate on a different concrete problem or example to suggest the range of legal issues and questionsto which economic reasoning can be productively applied. The ideas and
modes of analysis developed in the course are not difficult or mysterious, but
the questions of interpretation and policy that they raise about a subjectthat affects everyoneare challenging and
provocative.
prereq: No background is required; all are welcome!
summary: Think about the oldest and most familiar principles of American law, property and proportional liability, in a new and surprising way, and learn to apply economic reasoning to an especially important and interesting aspect of life.

url: https://www.coursera.org/course/composition
title: English Composition I: Achieving Expertise
objectives: English Composition I provides an introduction to and foundation
for the academic reading and writing characteristic of college. Attending
explicitly to disciplinary context, you will learn to read critically, write
effective arguments, understand the writing process, and craft powerful prose
that meets readers expectations. You will gain writing expertise by exploring questions about expertise itself: What factors impact expert achievement? What does it take to succeed? Who determines success? Since personal investment yields better writing, you can select an area of expertise meaningful to you (a hobby, trade, profession, discipline, etc.) for your major writing projects, which will be drafted and revised in sequenced stages: a critical response to an argument about expertise (2pp.); an explication of a visual image (2pp.); a case study of an expert (4pp.) and an Op-Ed (2 pp.). Your writing will be central to the course as we create a seminar/workshop structure with peer response and selected instructor feedback.Two overarching assumptions about academic writing will shape our work: 1) it is transferable; 2) it is learnable. Being an
effective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions and
engaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These skills are useful across
virtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well.
Perhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration
or genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback. This means that, with
practice, dedication, and working with others,can be an effective academic
writer and contribute your ideas to important, ongoing conversations. Let's start now.
prereq: Students should have basic English proficiency and exposure
to secondary-level English or composition.
summary: You will gain a foundation for college-level writing valuable for nearly any field. Students will learn how to read carefully, write effective arguments, understand the writing process, engage with others' ideas, cite accurately, and craft powerful prose. We will create a workshop environment.

title: "Pay Attention!!" ADHD Through the Lifespan
objectives: It is estimated that 5-8% of school-aged children and 4% of adults in the United States suffer from some form of attention deficit disorder and that the incidence of the disorder is increasing in the population. Although it is the most widely studied behavior disorder of childhood, its etiology remains unclear, its outcome is variable, and its treatment is complex and moderately successful. Advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of ADHD, pointing to key neural circuits involved in attention, behavioral control, learning, and reward maintenance that appear to be underperforming in patients with the disorder. Moreover, the etiology of this heterogeneous disorder points to the key role of genetic andenvironmental interactions during prenatal and perinatal periods. Over the past decade, new diagnostic and interventional approaches have enabled clinicians to better diagnose and treat ADHD across the lifespan, while longitudinal studies have elucidated the long-term impact of the disorder on health and adaptive functioning.This course is intended for students with a background in psychology and/or neuroscience who are interested in learning more about the complexities of ADHD from both scientific and clinical perspectives. Scientific topics covered include prevalence and epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation at different ages, impact on development (intellect, academic, speech and language, emotional self control, motivation and executive functioning), health outcomes (risk taking, accidents, injuries, driving difficulties, unintended pregnancy), co-existing conditions (anxiety, mood, substance use disorders), and etiology (genetic, pre/perinatal, neurodevelopmental, neuroanatomic, neuropsychological). Clinical topics covered include approaches to assessment, medication treatments (stimulant and non-stimulant), and non-medical interventions.
prereq: Prior experience in psychology and/or neuroscience is encouraged, but all are welcome!
summary: This course reviews current scientific knowledge and clinical approaches to Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and examines its impact on development, functioning and health outcomes.

title: MOS Transistors
objectives: The MOS transistor (MOSFET) is the workhorse of the microelectronic revolution. It isestimated that there are currently over1 billion transistors per human being in the world. Part of the MOS transistor's success lies in its very small size (you can fit 1,000 of them within theof a human hair!), part lies on some amazing things this devicecan do. However, the descriptions of MOS transistors in basic electronics courses cannot begin to dojustice to this device.If you want to really know how the MOSFEToperates, and how to model it, you need to study it carefully and systematically. This course will help you do just that.The course starts with a review of basic physical principles, and expands into a detailed treatment of MOS transistor phenomena, in a logical and systematic fashion, enhanced by intuitive discussions. We discuss a hierarchy of models - from the simple to the sophisticated - clearly identifying the connections between them, and encompassing many aspects of modeling, including dc, large-signal transient operation, quasi-static operation, non-quasi-static operation, small-signal operation,noise, and structural effects. We discuss the concepts on whichthe most popular CAD (computer-aided design) MOS transistor models are based.
prereq: This course assumes abackground in basic calculus andin basiccircuits and
electronics. The course will include a quickrefresher of basic semiconductor concepts(electrons and holes,intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors, drift and diffusion, etc.).
summary: Learn how MOS transistors work, and how to model them. The understanding provided in this course is essential not only for device modelers, but also for designers of high-performance circuits.

title: VLSI CAD:  Logic to Layout
objectives: A modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast: billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called intellectual property or IP blocks). How do people manage to design these complicated chips? Answer: a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design. Our focus is on the key representations that make it possible to synthesize, and to verify, these designs, as they move from logic to layout.Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. You should be taking this course if (1) you are interested in building VLSI design tools; (2) you are interested in designing VLSI chips, and you want to know why the tools do what they do; (3) you just like cool algorithms, that work on big cool problems that involve bits, and gates, and geometry, and graphs, and matrices, and time, and...
prereq: Programming experience (C++, Java) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms. An understanding of basic digital design: Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design. Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering. Exposure to basic VLSI at an undergraduate level is nice -- but its not necessary. We will keep the course self-contained, but students with some VLSI will be able to skip some background material.
summary: A modern VLSI chip has a zillion parts -- logic, control, memory, interconnect, etc. How do we design these complex chips? Answer: CAD software tools. Learn how to build these tools in this class.

title: Know Thyself
objectives: The Delphic Oracle is said to have had two premier injunctions: NOTHING IN EXCESS, and KNOW THYSELF. This course will be an examination of the latter injunction. Our central questions fall into two categories. First, What is it? We shall inquire into just what self-knowledge is: Is it a form of inner perception, somewhat like proprioception, by virtue of which our minds (and hearts) have internal scanners of their own states? Or should we construe self-knowledge in a way not crucially relying on a perceptual model? In that case, what other model might we use? Second, Why is it such a big deal? We shall inquire into the question why self-knowledge should be thought so important. Just what, if anything, is missing from a person lacking in self-knowledge that makes her significantly less wise, virtuous, or able than others who have this capacity? Our exploration will take us into research in Western philosophy, psychoanalysis, current experimental psychology, neuroscience, aesthetics, and Eastern philosophy as well. In aid of these investigation we will become students of our own dreams, and cultivate some meditative practices.
prereq: 
summary: An investigation of the nature and limits of self-knowledge from the viewpoints of philosophy, psychoanalysis, experimental psychology, neuroscience, aesthetics, and Buddhism. Readings are drawn from classical Western, non-Western, and contemporary sources.

objectives: This course is a survey of ancient Greek history, covering the roughly
13 centuries that extended from the Minoan / Mycenaean Bronze Age (ca.
1800-1200 BCE) down to the death of Socrates in 399 BCE. Along with
studying the most important events and personalities, we will consider
broader issues such as political and cultural values and methods of historical
interpretation.Some of the topics we will cover include: relations between the Greeks
and their neighbors to the East; Homer and the heroic ideal; the development
of the type of community called the "polis"; the diffusion of Greek civilization
from Southern Italy to the shores of the Black Sea; gods and mortals in
myth, religion and ritual; the roles of women; Athenian drama; the treatment
of slaves and foreigners; and the birth and evolution of democracy. We
will strive to get as full an understanding as we can of this extraordinary,
and extraordinarily influential, society.Almost all the reading assignments are from ancient sources in translation.
No previous knowledge of ancient history is assumed.
prereq: This course is suitable for advanced high school students, college and
university undergraduates, and anyone who is interested in history. As
noted above, you do not have to have prior knowledge of ancient history.
To put it another way, all are welcome.

title: Property and Liability: An Introduction to Law and Economics
objectives: One of the most interesting
and important developments in social science since 1970 has been the
"discovery" of a consistent economic logic underlying the great
common law subjects of property, contract, tort and crime, the
thousand-year-old bedrock of the English and American legal systems. Property
and contract provide the institutional
scaffolding that makes free exchange in markets possible, while the liability
systems of tort and crime appear tomimic market exchange in areas of human activity
where free exchange itself, for well-defined reasons, is not possible. This
course seeks to expose this underlying economic logic through the close
investigation of a series of paradigmatic problems and examples in light of
some simple but very powerful economic ideas. The course assumes no prior
background in economics or law, and begins with an introduction to the basic
concepts of property, exchange, efficiency and externality. On this foundation,
specific topics in the law, including property, tortand crime, eminent domain, intellectual property and criminal procedure,are considered. Each group of lectures will
elaborate on a different concrete problem or example to suggest the range of legal issues and questionsto which economic reasoning can be productively applied. The ideas and
modes of analysis developed in the course are not difficult or mysterious, but
the questions of interpretation and policy that they raise about a subjectthat affects everyoneare challenging and
provocative.
prereq: No background is required; all are welcome!
summary: Think about the oldest and most familiar principles of American law, property and proportional liability, in a new and surprising way, and learn to apply economic reasoning to an especially important and interesting aspect of life. 
title: English Composition I: Achieving Expertise
objectives: English Composition I provides an introduction to and foundation
for the academic reading and writing characteristic of college. Attending
explicitly to disciplinary context, you will learn to read critically, write
effective arguments, understand the writing process, and craft powerful prose
that meets readers expectations. You will gain writing expertise by exploring questions about expertise itself: What factors impact expert achievement? What does it take to succeed? Who determines success? Since personal investment yields better writing, you can select an area of expertise meaningful to you (a hobby, trade, profession, discipline, etc.) for your major writing projects, which will be drafted and revised in sequenced stages: a critical response to an argument about expertise (2pp.); an explication of a visual image (2pp.); a case study of an expert (4pp.) and an Op-Ed (2 pp.). Your writing will be central to the course as we create a seminar/workshop structure with peer response and selected instructor feedback.Two overarching assumptions about academic writing will shape our work: 1) it is transferable; 2) it is learnable. Being an
effective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions and
engaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These skills are useful across
virtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well.
Perhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration
or genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback. This means that, with
practice, dedication, and working with others,can be an effective academic
writer and contribute your ideas to important, ongoing conversations. Let's start now.
prereq: Students should have basic English proficiency and exposure
to secondary-level English or composition.
summary: You will gain a foundation for college-level writing valuable for nearly any field. Students will learn how to read carefully, write effective arguments, understand the writing process, engage with others' ideas, cite accurately, and craft powerful prose. We will create a workshop environment. 
title: Economic Issues, Food & You

prereq: This course consists of short video lectures, coupled with textbook and other readings.  There will be a quiz each week along with discussion forum posts and a journal assignment. The course relies heavily on applying economic principles to current events. Students must satisfactorily complete a project to earn a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction. Professor Clark will provide a Facebook and Twitter backchannel for students in the class.
summary: This course emphasizes the role of economics regarding its influence on food prices, the environment, and government policies. The primary objective of this course is to explore the basic tool kit of economic concepts that will enable students to critically analyze the choices they face as consumers and world citizens.
title: "Pay Attention!!" ADHD Through the Lifespan
objectives: It is estimated that 5-8% of school-aged children and 4% of adults in the United States suffer from some form of attention deficit disorder and that the incidence of the disorder is increasing in the population. Although it is the most widely studied behavior disorder of childhood, its etiology remains unclear, its outcome is variable, and its treatment is complex and moderately successful. Advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of ADHD, pointing to key neural circuits involved in attention, behavioral control, learning, and reward maintenance that appear to be underperforming in patients with the disorder. Moreover, the etiology of this heterogeneous disorder points to the key role of genetic andenvironmental interactions during prenatal and perinatal periods. Over the past decade, new diagnostic and interventional approaches have enabled clinicians to better diagnose and treat ADHD across the lifespan, while longitudinal studies have elucidated the long-term impact of the disorder on health and adaptive functioning.This course is intended for students with a background in psychology and/or neuroscience who are interested in learning more about the complexities of ADHD from both scientific and clinical perspectives. Scientific topics covered include prevalence and epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation at different ages, impact on development (intellect, academic, speech and language, emotional self control, motivation and executive functioning), health outcomes (risk taking, accidents, injuries, driving difficulties, unintended pregnancy), co-existing conditions (anxiety, mood, substance use disorders), and etiology (genetic, pre/perinatal, neurodevelopmental, neuroanatomic, neuropsychological). Clinical topics covered include approaches to assessment, medication treatments (stimulant and non-stimulant), and non-medical interventions.
prereq: Prior experience in psychology and/or neuroscience is encouraged, but all are welcome!
summary: This course reviews current scientific knowledge and clinical approaches to Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and examines its impact on development, functioning and health outcomes.
title: MOS Transistors
objectives: The MOS transistor (MOSFET) is the workhorse of the microelectronic revolution. It isestimated that there are currently over1 billion transistors per human being in the world. Part of the MOS transistor's success lies in its very small size (you can fit 1,000 of them within theof a human hair!), part lies on some amazing things this devicecan do. However, the descriptions of MOS transistors in basic electronics courses cannot begin to dojustice to this device.If you want to really know how the MOSFEToperates, and how to model it, you need to study it carefully and systematically. This course will help you do just that.The course starts with a review of basic physical principles, and expands into a detailed treatment of MOS transistor phenomena, in a logical and systematic fashion, enhanced by intuitive discussions. We discuss a hierarchy of models - from the simple to the sophisticated - clearly identifying the connections between them, and encompassing many aspects of modeling, including dc, large-signal transient operation, quasi-static operation, non-quasi-static operation, small-signal operation,noise, and structural effects. We discuss the concepts on whichthe most popular CAD (computer-aided design) MOS transistor models are based.
prereq: This course assumes abackground in basic calculus andin basiccircuits and
electronics. The course will include a quickrefresher of basic semiconductor concepts(electrons and holes,intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors, drift and diffusion, etc.).

business. Companies communicate their
performance to outsiders and evaluate the performance of their employees using information
generated by the accounting system. Learning
the language of accounting is essential for anyone that must make decisions
based on financial information.The course is designed to provide an understanding of financial
accounting fundamentals for prospective users of corporate financial
information, such as investors, creditors, employees, and other stakeholders
(e.g., suppliers, customers). The course focuses on understanding how economic events such
as operating activities, corporate investments, and financing transactions are
recorded in the three main financial statements (i.e., the income statement,
balance sheet, and statement of cash flows). Students will develop the technical
skills needed to analyze financial statements and disclosures for use in
financial analysis. Students will also
learn how accounting standards and managerial incentives affect the financial
reporting process.
prereq: The course is recommended for students with little or no prior background in
financial accounting that want to improve their financial literacy. There are no academic
prerequisites for the course. Although
we will work with numbers in the course, the only required math knowledge is
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
summary: This course will improve your fluency in financial accounting, the language of business.  You will learn how to read, understand, and analyze most of the information provided by companies in their financial statements.  These skills will help you make more informed decisions using financial information.

title: A Brief History of Humankind
objectives: One hundred thousand years ago,was still an insignificant animal minding its own business in a
corner of Africa. Our ancestors shared the
planet with at least five other human species, and their role in the ecosystem
was no greater than that of gorillas, fireflies, or jellyfish. Then, about
70,000 years ago, a mysterious change took place in the cognitive abilities oftransforming it into the master of the entire planet and the
terror of the ecosystem. Today it stands on the verge of becoming a god,
molding not only its surroundings but also its own body and mind.The
course will explain howconquered planet Earth, and what it
did with its newly acquired power. How didmanage to drive
all other human species to extinction, along with about half of the worlds
large terrestrial mammals? When did money and gods appear, and why? How did
empires rise and fall, and why is it possible for small minorities to lord it
over vast numbers of subject populations? Why did almost all societies believe
that women are inferior to men? What was the role of religion in history, and
why did monotheism become the most widespread type of religion? How did science
and capitalism become the dominant creeds of the modern era? Does history have
a direction? Did people become happier as history progressed? And what are the
chances thatwill still be around in a hundred years?
prereq: There are no entry requirements.
The course is intended both to people who have never studied history seriously,
and wish to gain an overview of the human past, and to people who have studied
history before, but who would like to get a fresh and challenging perspective
on it.
summary: The course surveys the entire length of human history, from the evolution of various human species in the Stone Age up to the political and technological revolutions of the twenty-first century.

title: The Social Context of Mental Health and Illness
objectives: Mental health and mental illness used to be something that people didnt talk about, but now it seems every time we open a newspaper we are hearing about the importance of mental health, or the consequences of mental illness. At this point in our history we understand mental illness and mental health to be largely influenced by biological factors, specifically, workings of the brain. At the same time, we have always known that social factors play a very strong role in promoting mental health and can make big differences in who gets mentally ill, who gets treated for mental illness, and how people can achieve good quality of life after a mental health diagnosis.This course is an opportunity to explore how social practices and ideas contribute to the ways in which society, families and individuals are affected by mental health and mental illness. We will look at issues like why some people think mental illness is a myth, how people think about mental health and illness in different cultures, who gets mentally ill and why, how families are affected by mental illness and what interventions are available to treat mental illness and promote mental health.
prereq: A basic background in introductory psychology is recommended.
summary: Learn how social factors promote mental health, influence the onset and course of mental illness, and affect how mental illnesses are diagnosed and treated.

title: Principles of Public Health
objectives: Principles of Public Healthintroduces the major concepts of public health and the
determinants of health status in communities. The course emphasizes the
ecological model that focuses on the linkages and relationships among multiple
natural and social determinants affecting health. As a relative concept, the
health of populations is assessed through comparisons of temporal, spatial, and
demographic dimensions of disease burden. The goal of public health is to
understand why and how different populations carry different kinds and amounts
of disease burden, and to use that knowledge for improving health by preventing
disease.Students in the course will explore successful examples in
public health, including how scientific discoveries and regulatory policies
have both contributed to mitigate risk factors and improve health outcomes. How
socioeconomic and cultural factors modify the effectiveness of risk
intervention and disease prevention strategies. How individual actions and
collective initiatives play important roles in determining the status of
health. In addition, how the various methodological approaches that guide
discoveries in public health have been applied from the local scale to the
global level.
prereq: Proficiency through college preparatory high school curriculum including two years of biology, a combination of natural science courses including one year each of mathematics and chemistry, and courses in health science and social sciences are recommended.

url: https://www.coursera.org/course/microeconomics
title: Microeconomics
objectives: This course is designed to introduce students to basic microeconomic theory
at a relatively rapid pace. The focus will be on fundamental economic principles
that can be used by managers to think about business problems, including
those inside the firm (relating to the problem of administering the firms
resources in the most cost-effective way) and those outside the firm (relating
to broader market and government forces that can affect the behavior of
firms). The course will not deal directly with standard managerial economics,
which tends to emphasize the mathematics and statistical techniques used
in optimizing firm decisions. However, every effort will be made to apply
basic principles to management problems, mainlythose relating to
getting incentives right for customers, suppliers, workers, managers, and
owners. Accordingly, this course will focus on an emerging subdiscipline
within economics,. It will stress methods
of thinking, and students will be evaluated on their ability to recall,
use, and extend the methods of thinking that are covered during the quarter.
prereq: Some microeconomic courses are math-heavy. They require calculus as a
prerequisite. In this course, the goal is to instillabout
business. Little math is used in the lectures (and Professor McKenzie's
textbook to which the lectures are tied), but that does not mean the analysis
will not be sophisticated, challenging, and rewarding. Indeed, on
finishing this course,students will be impressed with how challenging
and sophisticated business decisions can be and how useful the economic
way of thinking can be in understanding business problemsand in guiding
business decisions.
summary: This course is designed to introduce students to basic microeconomic theory at a relatively rapid pace without the use of complicated mathematics. The focus will be on fundamental economic principles that can be used by managers to think about business problems, including those that arise from coordinating workers and managers inside firms and from dealing with outside market forces and government policies.

title: Bioinformatics Algorithms (Part 1)
objectives: Sequencing thehuman genome in 2001 started a computational revolution
    in biology, whichhas arguably been an impetus for more newalgorithms
    than any other fundamental realm ofscience. The newly formedlinks
    between computer science and biology affect the way we teach computational
    ideas to biologists, as well as how applied algorithms are taught to computer
    scientists.Genome sequencing is just one of hundreds of biological problems that
    have become inextricable from the computational methods required to solve
    them. In this course, we will take a look at some of the algorithmic ideas
    that arefundamental to anunderstanding of modern biology.
    Computational concepts like dynamic programming and network analysis will
    help us explore algorithms applied toa wide range of biological topics,
    from finding genes to reconstructing the tree of life. Throughout
    the process, we will applybioinformatics tools and analyzegenetic
    data.In order to streamline homework assignments and solidify the material
    covered in the course, we will employ Rosalind (),
    a fun new resource for learning bioinformatics that wasfounded by
    the instructors. We hope that Rosalindwillshow youhow
    fun solving problems inbioinformatics can be.

prereq: Some microeconomic courses are math-heavy. They require calculus as a
prerequisite. In this course, the goal is to instillabout
business. Little math is used in the lectures (and Professor McKenzie's
textbook to which the lectures are tied), but that does not mean the analysis
will not be sophisticated, challenging, and rewarding. Indeed, on
finishing this course,students will be impressed with how challenging
and sophisticated business decisions can be and how useful the economic
way of thinking can be in understanding business problemsand in guiding
business decisions.
summary: This course is designed to introduce students to basic microeconomic theory at a relatively rapid pace without the use of complicated mathematics. The focus will be on fundamental economic principles that can be used by managers to think about business problems, including those that arise from coordinating workers and managers inside firms and from dealing with outside market forces and government policies.

title: Measuring Causal Effects in the Social Sciences
objectives: In this course
we discuss how to identify causal effect in the social sciences. Causal effects
are interesting whenever we want to understand.As
an example we can think of the case of wage differentials across gender. This
may be due to either discrimination from employers or differences in unobserved
background characteristics across gender. Usually we would like to think about
discrimination as a mechanism whereas differences in background characteristics
would usually not been seen as a mechanism. So it may be important to be able
to tell why there is pay differences across gender.During the course we will
examine such research designs and strategies and look at the relevance of different assumptions behind these
methods. The course also addresses the benefits of experimental data and introduces several new statistical and econometrical methods designed to improve causal statements from
non-experimental and observational data.
prereq: 
summary: How can we know if the differences in wages between men and women are caused by discrimination or differences in background characteristics? In this course we look at causal effects as opposed to spurious relationships. We will discuss how they can be identified in the social sciences using quantitative data, and describe how this can help us understand social mechanisms.

title: Markets with Frictions
objectives: The classical economic theory of markets cannot account for some important
    issues, such as the coexistence of unemployment and vacancies; credit market
    rationing; or bubbles and crashes in asset prices. This course will explore
    markets with frictions, shedding light on these issues and other fundamental
    questions such as: What is a bank, why do we use money, and how do organizations
    like firms or families emerge?
prereq: Students will receive a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this
class.
summary: This course explores markets with frictions. The goal is to sharpen our economic reasoning, add a few twists that you are unlikely to have seen in other courses, and apply the methods to interesting phenomena. This should improve the way you think analytically about the economy, and help address interesting issues that come up in the world of business.

title: Machine Learning
objectives: Machine learning algorithms can figure out how to perform important tasks by generalizing from examples. This is often feasible and cost-effective when manual programming is not. Machine learning (also known as data mining, pattern recognition and predictive analytics) is used widely in business, industry, science and government, and there is a great shortage of experts in it. If you pick up a machine learning textbook you may find it forbiddingly mathematical, but in this class you will learn that the key ideas and algorithms are in fact quite intuitive. And powerful!Most of the class will be devoted to supervised learning (in other words, learning in which a teacher provides the learner with the correct answers at training time). This is the most mature and widely used type of machine learning. We will cover the main supervised learning techniques, including decision trees, rules, instances, Bayesian techniques, neural networks, model ensembles, and support vector machines. We will also touch on learning theory with an emphasis on its practical uses. Finally, we will cover the two main classes of unsupervised learning methods: clustering and dimensionality reduction. Throughout the class there will be an emphasis not just on individual algorithms but on ideas that cut across them and tips for making them work.In the class projects you will build your own implementations of machine learning algorithms and apply them to problems like spam filtering, clickstream mining, recommender systems, and computational biology. This will get you as close to becoming a machine learning expert as you can in ten weeks!
prereq: The main prerequisite for this class is basic knowledge of programming. Some previous exposure to probability, statistics, linear algebra, calculus and/or logic is useful but not essential.
summary: Why write programs when the computer can instead learn them from data? In this class you will learn how to make this happen, from the simplest machine learning algorithms to quite sophisticated ones. Enjoy!

title: Listening to World Music
objectives: With the click of a mouse, now more than ever we are able to access sounds made by people from all around the world. And yet, most of us don't listen to the wide diversity of music available to us, probably because it sounds so strange. This class will open up the world of music to you. We begin with a brief history of recording technology, the music industry and the place of world music in that narrative; you are introduced to keywords for talking about music cross-culturally; and then proceed to half a dozen musical cultures around the world. In each of these musical cultures, we examine the ways in which music works in those distant cultures, how it sounds, what it means, who may perform it; and then we ask ourselves where this music has traveled and entered into the Western popular culture as entertainment, political discourse, or artistic purpose.
prereq: Though it may be useful, you are not required to have any music theoretical knowledge to take the class. You will learn not just about music as absolute sound, but about how music works in particular communities, and as a globally distributed, and often politically contested, entity.
summary: Learn the ideas and vocabulary for listening to world music, and examine the music of several world music cultures and how they have entered into mainstream popular culture.

title: Introduction to Sociology
objectives: We live in a world that is changing very quickly. Sociology gives us the tools to understand our own lives and those quite remote from us. The premise of this class is that in order to benefit from the sociological perspective, we need to learn how to ask certain basic questions. We need to know how to seek answers through methods that strive to be systematic and generalizable.We will begin with some of the essential questions: How are the things that we take to be natural socially constructed? How do we live today? How determined is social life? Does the individual make a difference? How is social order possible? Then we will ask what techniques are available to make sense of these questions. We will review comparative, historical, demographic, experimental, and ethnographic methods. Along the way, we will study core concepts including ethnocentrism, social networks, community, unanticipated consequences, social capital, race, class, and gender.We will strive to understand how interaction in micro-level contexts affects larger social processes and how such macro-level processes influence our day to day lives. We will learn to conceive of inequality by asking how race, class, and gender work in tandem. We will address one of the crises of recent sociology -- whether we can actually isolate the effects of social context. We will think about how social science is changing at a time when we are literally swimming in oceans of data generated by the internet.
prereq: None; all are welcome.
summary: In this class we will cover the essentials of sociology, to help you better understand your own life and situations far from your experience.

title: Introduction to Databases
objectives: "Introduction to Databases" had a very successful public offering in fall
2011, as one of Stanford's inaugural three massive open online courses.
Since then, the course materials have been improved and expanded, and all
materials are available for self-study. Students have access to lectures
with in-video quizzes, multiple-choice quiz assignments, automatically-checked
interactive programming exercises, midterm and final exams, a discussion
forum, optional additional exercises with solutions, and pointers to readings
and resources. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the curriculum draws
from Stanford's popular Introduction to Databases course. The material
presented here is the same as the corresponding material presented on Stanford's
Class2Go platform.Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by
most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge
fraction of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications
systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software
system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information.
In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other
properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability,
efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level
query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer
science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most
useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.
prereq: The course does not assume prior knowledge of any specific topics, however
a solid computer science foundation -- a reasonable amount of programming,
as well as knowledge of basic computer science theory -- will make the
material more accessible.
summary: This course covers database design and the use of database management systems for applications.

title: Introduction to Classical Music
objectives: This is a course for students who are passionate about classical music
and eager to learn more about it, but who have not necessarily had any
advanced technical training or taken any college-level music courses. The
only prerequisite is a basic knowledge of how to read musical notation.
Otherwise, no prior experience is needed; all concepts will be explained
in class, and musical terms will be defined as they arise. This course
will focus on Western classical music of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, music that exemplifies tonality, the system of major and minor
keys, including pieces composed by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann,
Chopin, Wagner, Brahms, Richard Strauss, and others. This course will tell
two competing stories about tonal music and try to reconcile them. On one
hand, we will explore what all tonal pieces have in common, the shared
musical language that makes them intelligible and allows them to communicate;
on the other hand, we will try to discover what makes each piece unique,
how composers bend the common language to say something new. Although the
course will incorporate historical perspectives, it will not be a chronological
survey. Instead, it will combine music theory with aesthetics, balancing
principles of structural organization with insights into the aesthetic
meaning and effects of these principles. By illustrating his lectures with
his own performances at the keyboard, Professor Korsyn will bring the music
to life.
prereq:

The course focuses on key knowledge areas of sustainability theory and practice, including population, ecosystems, global change, energy, agriculture, water, environmental economics and policy, ethics, and cultural history.This subject is of vital importance, seeking as it does to uncover the principles of the long-term welfare of all the peoples of the planet. As sustainability is a cross-disciplinary field of study, this foundation requires intellectual breadth: as I describe it in the class text, understanding our motivations requires the humanities, measuring the challenges of sustainability requires knowledge of the sciences (both natural and social), and building solutions requires technical insight into systems (such as provided by engineering, planning, and management).
prereq: None
summary: This course introduces the academic discipline of sustainability and explores how todays human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations.
title: Introduction to Sociology
objectives: We live in a world that is changing very quickly. Sociology gives us the tools to understand our own lives and those quite remote from us. The premise of this class is that in order to benefit from the sociological perspective, we need to learn how to ask certain basic questions. We need to know how to seek answers through methods that strive to be systematic and generalizable.We will begin with some of the essential questions: How are the things that we take to be natural socially constructed? How do we live today? How determined is social life? Does the individual make a difference? How is social order possible? Then we will ask what techniques are available to make sense of these questions. We will review comparative, historical, demographic, experimental, and ethnographic methods. Along the way, we will study core concepts including ethnocentrism, social networks, community, unanticipated consequences, social capital, race, class, and gender.We will strive to understand how interaction in micro-level contexts affects larger social processes and how such macro-level processes influence our day to day lives. We will learn to conceive of inequality by asking how race, class, and gender work in tandem. We will address one of the crises of recent sociology -- whether we can actually isolate the effects of social context. We will think about how social science is changing at a time when we are literally swimming in oceans of data generated by the internet.
prereq: None; all are welcome.
summary: In this class we will cover the essentials of sociology, to help you better understand your own life and situations far from your experience.

title: Introduction to Databases
objectives: "Introduction to Databases" had a very successful public offering in fall
2011, as one of Stanford's inaugural three massive open online courses.
Since then, the course materials have been improved and expanded, and all
materials are available for self-study. Students have access to lectures
with in-video quizzes, multiple-choice quiz assignments, automatically-checked
interactive programming exercises, midterm and final exams, a discussion
forum, optional additional exercises with solutions, and pointers to readings
and resources. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the curriculum draws
from Stanford's popular Introduction to Databases course. The material
presented here is the same as the corresponding material presented on Stanford's
Class2Go platform.Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by
most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge
fraction of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications
systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software
system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information.
In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other
properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability,
efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level
query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer
science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most
useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.
prereq: The course does not assume prior knowledge of any specific topics, however
a solid computer science foundation -- a reasonable amount of programming,
as well as knowledge of basic computer science theory -- will make the
material more accessible.
summary: This course covers database design and the use of database management systems for applications.
title: Introduction to Classical Music
objectives: This is a course for students who are passionate about classical music
and eager to learn more about it, but who have not necessarily had any
advanced technical training or taken any college-level music courses. The
only prerequisite is a basic knowledge of how to read musical notation.
Otherwise, no prior experience is needed; all concepts will be explained
in class, and musical terms will be defined as they arise. This course
will focus on Western classical music of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, music that exemplifies tonality, the system of major and minor
keys, including pieces composed by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann,
Chopin, Wagner, Brahms, Richard Strauss, and others. This course will tell
two competing stories about tonal music and try to reconcile them. On one
hand, we will explore what all tonal pieces have in common, the shared
musical language that makes them intelligible and allows them to communicate;
on the other hand, we will try to discover what makes each piece unique,
how composers bend the common language to say something new. Although the
course will incorporate historical perspectives, it will not be a chronological
survey. Instead, it will combine music theory with aesthetics, balancing
principles of structural organization with insights into the aesthetic
meaning and effects of these principles. By illustrating his lectures with
his own performances at the keyboard, Professor Korsyn will bring the music
to life.
prereq: 
summary: This course will focus on Western classical music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; it is designed for people who are passionate about classical music but who have not necessarily had any advanced training or taken any college-level music courses.  The only prerequisite is a basic knowledge of how to read musical notation.

title: The Law of the European Union: An Introduction
objectives: In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for its decades-long
contribution to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and
human rights in Europe. War has become virtually unthinkable in the EU. When
the first steps towards supranational cooperation - primarily targeted at
preventing the rearmament of Germany - were made in the aftermath of World War
Two, the Founding Fathers of the European integration construct could never
have imagined this outcome in their wildest dreams. Over the years, the
supranational cooperation would widen - from the original European Communities
consisting of 6 Member States to the current Union of 27 Members  and deepen 
from the originally almost purely economically inspired Communities to the
current Union with a say in almost all areas of national competence. At the
same time, problems with the Euro have plunged the EU in one of the biggest
crises since its inception. This challenges lawmakers to tackle difficult questions
about the continued existence of the Euro and the future direction of the
European integration project.This course will give the students an insight into the law of the EU, a
vast and fascinating area of law which forms an integral part of the legal
systems of its 27 Member States. The course is divided
into three parts. In the first part, we will pay attention to the creation and the development of the EU, its
institutional structure and functioning, and the specific nature and sources of
EU law. In the second part, we will examine how EU law
impacts on the lives of EU citizens as well as on companies that are
established or provide services in the EU. In the final part, we will tackle Europes common currency crisis,
investigating causes, effects and possible routes out of this existential
crisis of the Union.If you are a student, lawyer, entrepreneur or simply
interested in the EU, itsdevelopment and legal system, this course will
provide you with the foundations.The course is of interest to people both
inside and outside the European Union: EU citizens may learn how to benefit
from the rights contained in EU life; people from other parts of the world may
learn from the EUs specific set-up, its functioning and the legal solutions
being applied in the European context.
prereq: 
summary: The EU is the most successful supranational legal order to which 27 Member States have transferred sovereign rights. This course explores the functioning of the unique creature that is the EU, the impact of its laws on states, citizens and companies, and the current challenges it faces.

title: The Diversity of Exoplanets
objectives: The discovery of extra-solar planets orbiting other stars has been one of the major breakthroughs in astronomy of the past decades, changing our view on the formation of planetary systems, mainly drawn from the observation of the Solar System.Today, over 860 exoplanets are known and the Kepler satellite has recently identified over 2700 additional candidates, most of them awaiting for confirmation. We have learned that exoplanets are extremely common objects in the Universe andthat planetary systems are much more diverse than originally predicted.Our knowledge about exoplanets has dramatically increased thanks to the systematic monitoring of stars in the solarneighborhood by radial velocities, photometry, microlensing,and recently direct imaging, bringing valuable constraints to planet formation theories,as well as to models of planet interior structure, and atmosphere physics. In this course, we will review the main discoveries, describing the different approaches to detect exoplanets andcharacterisetheir orbital and physical properties.
prereq: The class will consist of lecture videos, 
which are between 8 and 12 minutes in length. These contain 1-2 
integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone 
homeworks that are not part of video lectures.
summary: The course will provide an overview of the knowledge acquired during the past 20 years in the domain of exoplanets. It will review the different detection methods, their limitations, and the information provided on the orbital system and the planet itself, and how this information is helping our understanding of planet formation.

title: Terrorism and Counterterrorism: comparing theory and practice
objectives: Terrorism has
arguably been one of the defining factors of our age. It frequently
makes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private business and
ordinary citizens. And in many parts of the world, it has been one of the most
important threats to peace, security and stability. But what does this exactly
mean? What is the nature of this threat? Who or what is threatened, how, by
whom and why? What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact
of terrorism and make sure that terrorists do not make headlines and manage to
scare us?These are just a handful of questions that will
be addressd in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the
essence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to
an exploration of this phenomenon and the difficulties in defining it. The
second part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism
studies. Since 9/11 terrorism
studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats. But
what has academia come up with? What theories, assumptions and
conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding
terrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and compared
with empirical evidence with the aim to either stress their importance or to
debunk them as myths. The final part looks into the implications and
possibilities for policy making.
prereq: 
summary: Students, policy makers, journalists or anyone with a strong interest in terrorism and counter terrorism studies and trends will find the course most relevant. It will equip you with a range of insights that help you to analyze and understand these complex phenomena.

prereq: For thousands of years, people have believed that they are endowed with
souls and that their souls will survive the death of their bodies.
It is surprising that this common denominator of most religions has operated
in the shadows of public discussions. Up to now it has been one of those
elephants in the room that nobody talks about. This course breaks
that tradition and, in doing so, opens the doors to the fertile fields
of many disciplines that inform us about the durability of soul and afterlife
beliefs. Originally taught as an undergraduate "general education"
course at Rutgers University, it has attracted the attention of adults
of all ages and many occupations who like to think deeply about matters
that pertain to how we function as human beings.In sum, no background is required; all are welcome.
summary: Exploration of the causes and consequences of various beliefs about the soul. Topics such as the self, mind/body dualism, evolution, culture, death anxiety, afterlife, and religious and political conflict.

objectives: Everything is connected: people, information, events and places, all the more so with the advent of online social media. A practical way of making sense of the tangle of connections is to analyze them as networks. In this course you will learn about the structure and evolution of networks, drawing on knowledge from disciplines as diverse as sociology, mathematics, computer science, economics, and physics. Online interactive demonstrations and hands-on analysis of real-world data sets will focus on a range of tasks: from identifying important nodes in the network, to detecting communities, to tracing information diffusion and opinion formation.
prereq: There are no math or programming prerequisites for the class. There will be a few additional assignments for those with a programming background, which will use the R statistical programming language along with NetLogo.

title: Securing Digital Democracy
objectives: Computer technology has transformed how we participate in democracy. The way we cast our votes, the way our votes are counted, and the way we choose who will lead are increasingly controlled by invisible computer software. Most U.S. states have adopted electronic voting, and countries around the world are starting to collect votes over the Internet. However, computerized voting raises startling security risks that are only beginning to be understood outside the research lab, from voting machine viruses that can silently change votes to the possibility that hackers in foreign countries could steal an election. This course will provide the technical background and public policy foundation that 21st century citizens need to understand the electronic voting debate. You'll learn how electronic voting and Internet voting technologies work, why they're being introduced, and what problems they aim to solve. You'll also learn about the computer- and Internet-security risks these systems face and the serious vulnerabilities that recent research has demonstrated. We'll cover widely used safeguards, checks, and balances  and why they are often inadequate. Finally, we'll see how computer technology has the potential to improve election security, if it's applied intelligently. Along the way, you'll hear stories from the lab and from the trenches on a journey that leads from Mumbai jail cells to the halls of Washington, D.C. You'll come away from this course understanding why you can be confident your own vote will count  or why you should reasonably be skeptical.
prereq: The class will consist of lecture videos totaling about 2 hours a week. Thesewill several enrichment and evaluation questions. There will also be optional reading and a final essay.

what the effects of todays outsized deficits and debts could be on national
economies. It then moves to monetary
policy and explores its drawbacks and the recourse to other approaches, such as
quantitative easing. Finally, the course
looks at the other policies open to governments to address a crisis, and the
debate over how they have been used today.
prereq: A basic introductory course in economics or
business could help, but no knowledge is required;
summary: This course will take a non-technical approach to understanding how governments influence the macroeconomy.  Topics will include fiscal policy, deficits and debts, monetary policy and structural reform.  We will review some current debates, such as fiscal stimulus vs. austerity and rules vs. quantitative easing.
title: Understanding Media by Understanding Google
objectives: Google Inc. is one of the key success stories of the Internet era. The
    company has expanded beyond its original search business through innovation
    and acquisition to touch the lives of nearly every person who lives life
    online. Americans spend more than 3,400 hours per year using consumer media,
    the field where Googles impact is most profound, and increasingly must
    understand what thecompany has wroughtnot only to control our
    offline and online environments, but also to interact and engage successfully
    with anyone inourprofessional and personal lives.You will learn how to understand the tactics that modern media companies,
    journalists, marketers, politicians, technologists, and social networks
    are using to reach you and affect your behavior. You will learn how to
    adopt strategies that put them on an even footing with these entities in
    achieving your own communications goals. We'll
prereq: Students should enjoy reading; be curious about the companies whose products
and services have come to define the Internet; and be willing to examine
their own habits and behaviors in new contexts.
summary: Few Americans who just Google it to find an answer to their every question understand just what the company does (and why). Through this course, you'll join the minority that really gets it.
title: The Law of the European Union: An Introduction
objectives: In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for its decades-long
contribution to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and
human rights in Europe. War has become virtually unthinkable in the EU. When
the first steps towards supranational cooperation - primarily targeted at
preventing the rearmament of Germany - were made in the aftermath of World War
Two, the Founding Fathers of the European integration construct could never
have imagined this outcome in their wildest dreams. Over the years, the
supranational cooperation would widen - from the original European Communities
consisting of 6 Member States to the current Union of 27 Members  and deepen 
from the originally almost purely economically inspired Communities to the
current Union with a say in almost all areas of national competence. At the
same time, problems with the Euro have plunged the EU in one of the biggest
crises since its inception. This challenges lawmakers to tackle difficult questions
about the continued existence of the Euro and the future direction of the
European integration project.This course will give the students an insight into the law of the EU, a
vast and fascinating area of law which forms an integral part of the legal
systems of its 27 Member States. The course is divided
into three parts. In the first part, we will pay attention to the creation and the development of the EU, its
institutional structure and functioning, and the specific nature and sources of
EU law. In the second part, we will examine how EU law
impacts on the lives of EU citizens as well as on companies that are
established or provide services in the EU. In the final part, we will tackle Europes common currency crisis,
investigating causes, effects and possible routes out of this existential
crisis of the Union.If you are a student, lawyer, entrepreneur or simply
interested in the EU, itsdevelopment and legal system, this course will
provide you with the foundations.The course is of interest to people both
inside and outside the European Union: EU citizens may learn how to benefit
from the rights contained in EU life; people from other parts of the world may
learn from the EUs specific set-up, its functioning and the legal solutions
being applied in the European context.
prereq: 
summary: The EU is the most successful supranational legal order to which 27 Member States have transferred sovereign rights. This course explores the functioning of the unique creature that is the EU, the impact of its laws on states, citizens and companies, and the current challenges it faces.
title: The Holocaust
objectives: This course focuses on the destruction of Jews in Europe by Nazi Germany,
    but the true scope of the course is much broader; exploring also the shifting
    historical conditions from which the Holocaust emerged. Students will explore
    memoirs, historical documents, poetry, documentary footage, filmic representations,
    novels, and other media that help to illustrate the multiplicity and variety
    of human experience during this important historical episode.By the end of the course, you will have an expanded knowledge and understanding
    of Eastern and Western Jewish communities, the origins and development
    of antisemitism, the formation and operation of concentration camps, the
    resistance movements, and the Holocaust as a problem for world-history.
    Additionally, you will have engaged with the problematics of representation,
    memory, "the memorial", and witnessing.Thiscourse is supported by the Neufeld-Levin Chair in Holocaust
    studies.
prereq: 
summary: This course traces the destruction of the Jews and Jewish life in Europe by Nazi Germany, drawing on major works of history, literature, and film. The lectures outline the work of the Nazis as well as Jewish responses.
title: The Global Business of Sports
objectives: The wide range of global sports businesses constitutes a multi-billion
    dollar industry. This course will examine and explain the business of sports
    by analyzing the economic, legal, governance and success models in various
    sports industries. The primary focus will be on American team sports but
    comparative global models will be contemplated as well. We will seek
    to find the answers to questions such as: what lessons can global sports
    entities learn from each other? What business strategies are used to retain
    the profitability of world leagues, sports teams and franchises? What lessons
    can be drawn from the United States based sports models? What revised models
    should new entrepreneurial leagues apply in order to achieve success? Substantive
    instruction will be drawn from the likes of the Olympics, FIFA World Cup,
    MLB, NFL, Premier League, various player unions, China, India, South Africa,
    Brazil and much more. Ultimately, our goal is to equip the
    student with a framework and tools with which to understand and evaluate
    the business side of a wide range of competitive sports ventures.
prereq: None; all are welcome.
summary: This course analyzes the business side of sports and discusses the intricacies of global sports leagues as well as various countries' sports strategies. You will be equipped with a framework and tools to understand and evaluate the business side of competitive sports around the world.
title: The Diversity of Exoplanets
objectives: The discovery of extra-solar planets orbiting other stars has been one of the major breakthroughs in astronomy of the past decades, changing our view on the formation of planetary systems, mainly drawn from the observation of the Solar System.Today, over 860 exoplanets are known and the Kepler satellite has recently identified over 2700 additional candidates, most of them awaiting for confirmation. We have learned that exoplanets are extremely common objects in the Universe andthat planetary systems are much more diverse than originally predicted.Our knowledge about exoplanets has dramatically increased thanks to the systematic monitoring of stars in the solarneighborhood by radial velocities, photometry, microlensing,and recently direct imaging, bringing valuable constraints to planet formation theories,as well as to models of planet interior structure, and atmosphere physics. In this course, we will review the main discoveries, describing the different approaches to detect exoplanets andcharacterisetheir orbital and physical properties.
prereq: The class will consist of lecture videos, 
which are between 8 and 12 minutes in length. These contain 1-2 
integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone 
homeworks that are not part of video lectures.
summary: The course will provide an overview of the knowledge acquired during the past 20 years in the domain of exoplanets. It will review the different detection methods, their limitations, and the information provided on the orbital system and the planet itself, and how this information is helping our understanding of planet formation.

title: Terrorism and Counterterrorism: comparing theory and practice
objectives: Terrorism has
arguably been one of the defining factors of our age. It frequently
makes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private business and
ordinary citizens. And in many parts of the world, it has been one of the most
important threats to peace, security and stability. But what does this exactly
mean? What is the nature of this threat? Who or what is threatened, how, by
whom and why? What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact
of terrorism and make sure that terrorists do not make headlines and manage to
scare us?These are just a handful of questions that will
be addressd in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the
essence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to
an exploration of this phenomenon and the difficulties in defining it. The
second part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism
studies. Since 9/11 terrorism
studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats. But
what has academia come up with? What theories, assumptions and
conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding
terrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and compared
with empirical evidence with the aim to either stress their importance or to
debunk them as myths. The final part looks into the implications and
possibilities for policy making.
prereq: 
summary: Students, policy makers, journalists or anyone with a strong interest in terrorism and counter terrorism studies and trends will find the course most relevant. It will equip you with a range of insights that help you to analyze and understand these complex phenomena. 
title: Structural Equation Model and its Applications |
objectives: 1995 LISRELSince 1995, I have conducted close to a hundred large-scale structural equation workshops and am moved by Mainland Chinese students diligence and eagerness to learn.  However, China is geographically too large.  Even if I conduct free workshops at remote cities, a lot of students still cannot pay for the travel expenses to attend.  Therefore, I am now making publicly available an original web course that is used by our own students. I hope all Chinese students can now enjoy this course with plenty of exercises to monitor their learning. As most of the course content concentrates on the explanation and applications of theories, the course should be useful for students who intend to use LISREL or other software.

title: Soul Beliefs: Causes and Consequences
objectives: Throughout history, the vast majority of people around the globe have
    believed they have, however defined, a soul. While the question of whether
    the soul exists cannot be answered by
prereq: For thousands of years, people have believed that they are endowed with
souls and that their souls will survive the death of their bodies.
It is surprising that this common denominator of most religions has operated
in the shadows of public discussions. Up to now it has been one of those
elephants in the room that nobody talks about. This course breaks
that tradition and, in doing so, opens the doors to the fertile fields
of many disciplines that inform us about the durability of soul and afterlife
beliefs. Originally taught as an undergraduate "general education"
course at Rutgers University, it has attracted the attention of adults
of all ages and many occupations who like to think deeply about matters
that pertain to how we function as human beings.In sum, no background is required; all are welcome.
summary: Exploration of the causes and consequences of various beliefs about the soul. Topics such as the self, mind/body dualism, evolution, culture, death anxiety, afterlife, and religious and political conflict.
title: Social Network Analysis
objectives: Everything is connected: people, information, events and places, all the more so with the advent of online social media. A practical way of making sense of the tangle of connections is to analyze them as networks. In this course you will learn about the structure and evolution of networks, drawing on knowledge from disciplines as diverse as sociology, mathematics, computer science, economics, and physics. Online interactive demonstrations and hands-on analysis of real-world data sets will focus on a range of tasks: from identifying important nodes in the network, to detecting communities, to tracing information diffusion and opinion formation.
prereq: There are no math or programming prerequisites for the class. There will be a few additional assignments for those with a programming background, which will use the R statistical programming language along with NetLogo.
summary: This course will use social network analysis, both its theory and computational tools, to make sense of the social and information networks that have been fueled and rendered accessible by the internet.
title: Securing Digital Democracy
objectives: Computer technology has transformed how we participate in democracy. The way we cast our votes, the way our votes are counted, and the way we choose who will lead are increasingly controlled by invisible computer software. Most U.S. states have adopted electronic voting, and countries around the world are starting to collect votes over the Internet. However, computerized voting raises startling security risks that are only beginning to be understood outside the research lab, from voting machine viruses that can silently change votes to the possibility that hackers in foreign countries could steal an election. This course will provide the technical background and public policy foundation that 21st century citizens need to understand the electronic voting debate. You'll learn how electronic voting and Internet voting technologies work, why they're being introduced, and what problems they aim to solve. You'll also learn about the computer- and Internet-security risks these systems face and the serious vulnerabilities that recent research has demonstrated. We'll cover widely used safeguards, checks, and balances  and why they are often inadequate. Finally, we'll see how computer technology has the potential to improve election security, if it's applied intelligently. Along the way, you'll hear stories from the lab and from the trenches on a journey that leads from Mumbai jail cells to the halls of Washington, D.C. You'll come away from this course understanding why you can be confident your own vote will count  or why you should reasonably be skeptical.
prereq: The class will consist of lecture videos totaling about 2 hours a week. Thesewill several enrichment and evaluation questions. There will also be optional reading and a final essay.
summary: In this course, you'll learn what every citizen should know about the security risks--and future potential  of electronic voting and Internet voting.
title: Science, Technology, and Society in China III: The Present & Policy Implications
objectives: In this course, we examine science and technology in Chinese society today
as well as the basis for the policy prescriptions the Chinese government
is currently employing to promote innovation and technology development.
We will cover the impact of these policies on the efforts of Chinese companies
to enhance their global technological competitiveness. We will learn how
observers inside and outside China have come to regard the country as a
technological superpower, and analyze the extent to which this reflects
the actual situation today (and tomorrow).
prereq: The class will consist primarily of lecture videos, which will be enriched
with learning activities. There will also be short standalone homework
assignments that are independent of the video lectures.
summary: This course is the third in a trilogy of short courses. In this final part, we integrate what we have learned in the previous two parts to investigate the evolution and implications of Chinese government policies designed to promote scientific and technological progress. Based on this, we will attempt to sketch a picture of the future of science and technology in China.
title: Science, Technology, and Society in China II: History of S&T in Chinese Society
objectives: Having mastered in general terms some of the key concepts used in understanding
the relationship between science/technology and society, this course begins
to apply those concepts to China, historically and chronologically. Concepts
such as path dependency/lock-in effect, technological determinism and others
will be used to frame a narrative describing the emergence of science and
technology in Chinese society. This narrative will be heavily informed
by developments in the West during the Industrial Revolution so that we
can understand how that series of events affected the development of science
and technology in China. This part of the course will also lay the foundation
for.
prereq: The class will consist primarily of lecture videos, which will be enriched
with learning activities. There will also be short standalone homework
assignments that are independent of the video lectures.
summary: This course is the second in a trilogy of short courses. In this part, we apply some of the concepts we covered in Part I to study the development of science and technology in Chinese society, particularly in light of the influence the Industrial Revolution in the West has had on Chinas technological development.

objectives: Archaeology has
        as its objective the recovery and revival of humankind past,
        and as its aim
        the rescue and preservation of cultural heritage. The past was
        always the

title: Programming Languages
objectives: Learn many of the concepts that underlie all programming languages. Develop
a programming style known as functional programming and contrast it with
object-oriented programming. Through experience writing programs and studying
three different languages, learn the key issues in designing and using
programming languages, such as modularity and the complementary benefits
of static and dynamic typing. This course is neither particularly theoretical
nor just about programming specifics  it will give you a framework for
understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design
correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you learn to
think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language.
The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to
write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs  in any language.
prereq: The course assumes students are familiar with programming covered by most
introductory courses, but it is explicitly designed not to be a particularly
advanced course. Students should be comfortable with variables, conditionals,
arrays, linked lists, stacks, and recursion (though recursion will be reviewed
and expanded upon), and the difference between an interface and an implementation.
Students should be eager to write programs in languages new to them. Parts
of the course analyze basic object-oriented concepts and contrast them
with those of other languages, so familiarity with Java or a closely related
language (e.g., C#) is helpful, but not required for homework assignments.
summary: Investigate the basic concepts behind programming languages, with a strong emphasis on the techniques and benefits of functional programming. Use the programming languages ML, Racket, and Ruby in ways that will teach you how the pieces of a language fit together to create more than the sum of the parts. Gain new software skills and the concepts needed to learn new languages on your own.

title: Principles of Obesity Economics
objectives: Economics motivates consumer behavior based on preferences, relative prices,
and time and money constraints. Economics motivates the role for
government based on market failure. Obesity has been deemed a critical
public health problem. This course explores how consumer choices
lead to individuals being different weights and discusses whether there
is an economic rationale for government intervention in the markets most
closely related to food and activity choices.
prereq: An understanding of issues related to the health impacts of obesity or
some basic microeconomics is helpful but not necessary.
summary: The resources available to individuals and society and the prices of goods in the market shape our choices - even about the food we eat and the weight at which we live. This course explores the economic motivation for consumer choice and the economic role of government in markets related to obesity.

objectives: Earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, ice ages, landslides, floods, life evolution, plate motionsall of these phenomena have interacted over the vast expanses of deep time to sculpt the dynamic planet that we live on today. Planet Earth presents an overview of our home, from a geological perspective. We learn how the elements comprising the Earth formed in the guts of stars and supernovae, how Earth and its Solar System neighbors formed from a vast cloud of gas and dust over 4.5 billion years ago. And how the atmosphere, oceans, and rocks of our planet form and change. We will emphasize how plate tectonicsthe grand unifying theory of geologyexplains how the map of our planet's surface has changed radically over geologic time, and why as present-day geologic activityincluding a variety of devastating natural disastersoccur where they do. We will also discuss the fascinating interactions and exchanges that take place among land, sea, air, and life, and how these interactions they result in the great variety of landscapesfrom deserts to glaciersthat make our planet unique, and influence climate change in the past and, potentially the future. Finally, we will delve into the processes that produce the energy and mineral resources that modern society depends on, to help understand the context of the environment and sustainability challenges that we will face in the future.
prereq: None
summary: Planet Earth, an overview of geology, discusses how earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, floods, ice ages, evolution, climate, and plate tectonics have interacted over deep time to produce a our dynamic island in space, and its unique landscapes.

title: Physics 1 for Physical Science Majors
objectives: This course is a rigorous introduction to classical mechanics, which is the study of forces and motion. How does gravity control the motion of the
planets around the sun or the motion of a projectile fired from a cannon? Why does a spinning skater spin faster when
she pulls her arms in? Why is a
perpetual motion machine impossible? These are the kinds of questions which can
be answered with classical mechanics, which was first formulated by Isaac
Newton around 1666. Classical, or Newtonian Mechanics is the oldest branch of
physics, but it will never go out of style.
It remains the foundation of our understanding of the physical world and
is constantly used by engineers and scientists. There is a space probe, called
New Horizons, that is on its way to Pluto right now, and it will arrive on July
14, 2015, exactly on time and on target, because its path has been computed
using classical mechanics, and nothing
more.
prereq: This course is aimed at freshmen engineering students and
other physical science majors at the University-level. Studetns will need a good command of algebra
and trigonometry before they start this course, and some acquaintance with
calculus. Calculus is not used much in
this course, and we will review that calculus that we do use. For the student taking this course for credit
at the University of Colorado, Calculus 1 is the co-requisite for the course;
that is, they are required to take calc1 concurrently, if they have not already
taken it. No previous knowledge of
physics is assumed, but this course is fast-paced and we cover a lot of
material, so any previous high-school physics course will be very useful.
summary: Coming in Fall 2013: This is the first semester of a 2-semester introductory physics sequence taught at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The course is intended for physical science majors and others desiring a rigorous introduction to physics. The course covers classical mechanics, including kinematics, dynamics, conservation laws, and applications.

title: Nutrition and Physical Activity for Health
objectives: Over 65 percent of adults and over 30 percent of children meet the classification
of being overweight or obese, and with this excess weight comes numerous
health conditions that include heart disease, diabetes, cancer, musculoskeletal
disorders, and even impairments in cognitive function. Because in most
cases the core cause of obesity and its related health conditions is a
poor quality of diet and lack of sufficient physical activity, it is no
surprise that to reverse this health problem a foundation of proper nutrition
and sufficient physical activity is imperative.This course is designed to provide a foundation of nutritional knowledge
to develop a sustainable pattern of healthy eating. To this will be added
a foundation of knowledge related to physical activity and exercise. These
two key lifestyle behaviors are then brought together under the umbrella
of calorie balance, which is the understanding of how we balance the calories
that we eat in our diet with the calories that we burn to sustain life
and to perform all of our daily tasks and functions.Ultimately, this information can only be of value if individuals understand
how to engage in these healthy behaviors within their daily lives when
they are faced with challenges and barriers. This course will address key
issues and will provide information on effective strategies for adopting
and maintaining these targeted behaviors as they apply to the adoption
and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.
prereq: There are no prerequisites for this course. However, a general background
in basic nutrition and physical activity may be helpful to the student
prior to taking this course.
summary: This course will provide a coherent, understandable look at the evidence on how nutrition and physical activity impact health through lower morbidity, longevity, and quality of life.

title: Modern European Mysticism and Psychological Thought
objectives: In the revival of mysticism today, mysticism has
become more psychological while psychology is increasingly interested in
mysticism. This course will provide an entry into the complex world of modern
mysticism, through studying its psychological thought. We shall begin with
exploring the interpretations of mystical experience offered by psychoanalysts
in the twentieth century, starting with Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung and ending
with contemporary thinkers such as James Hillman. However, we will see that the
European mystical traditions, including Kabbalah in the Jewish world and those
of the Catholic and Protestant worlds, developed their own elaborate systems of
psychological thought. Thus, we will mostly examine mystical psychology on its
own terms. We shall especially look at two terms that are very much in use also
in general culture: the heart (as an emotional rather than as a physical center!...)
and the soul, looking at the unique mystical concepts of their nature and destiny
and asking if there were influences and meetings between the different
religions.
prereq:

better for the environment? To answer these questions, one must take
a holistic systems view using a quantitative approach known as life cycle
assessment.Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a fundamental method for assessing the
environmental impacts of products and technologies from a "cradle to grave"
systems perspective. It is an essential tool for anyone who performs
environmental analyses or uses the results of such analyses for decision
making.The course will provide an introduction to LCA methods and applications.
Students taking this course will emerge with a solid understanding of why
an LCA systems perspective is important, basic skills for sound application
of the LCA method and proper interpretation of its results, and an appreciation
for the strengths and limitations of LCA in practice. The course
will cover the four major steps in LCA: (1) goal definition and scope;
(2) life-cycle inventory compilation; (3) life-cycle impact assessment;
and (4) interpretation and management. The course will include a
hands-on modeling project, which the students will perform in parallel
to the lectures to reinforce learning objectives and to gain experience
in LCA application.
prereq: Familiarity with spreadsheet software (preferably Microsoft Excel), basic
skills in algebra, matrix operations, and statistics, and some exposure
to environmental issues related to air pollution, water pollution, waste
generation, and climate change is all you need to succeed in this course.

title: Recovering the Humankind Past and Saving the Universal Heritage
objectives: Archaeology has
        as its objective the recovery and revival of humankind past,
        and as its aim
        the rescue and preservation of cultural heritage. The past was
        always the
        object of attention in the ancient civilizations. In the modern
        world,
        Archaeology is no longer about theclassification of found objects, but rather aboutunderstanding ancient
        cultures. Its fascination is precisely in its methods: a path
        inevitably
        fluctuating between identity and alterity.
prereq: 
summary: Archaeology has as its objective the recovery and revival of humankind past, and as its aim the rescue and preservation of cultural heritage.
title: Programming Languages
objectives: Learn many of the concepts that underlie all programming languages. Develop
a programming style known as functional programming and contrast it with
object-oriented programming. Through experience writing programs and studying
three different languages, learn the key issues in designing and using
programming languages, such as modularity and the complementary benefits
of static and dynamic typing. This course is neither particularly theoretical
nor just about programming specifics  it will give you a framework for
understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design
correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you learn to
think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language.
The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to
write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs  in any language.
prereq: The course assumes students are familiar with programming covered by most
introductory courses, but it is explicitly designed not to be a particularly
advanced course. Students should be comfortable with variables, conditionals,
arrays, linked lists, stacks, and recursion (though recursion will be reviewed
and expanded upon), and the difference between an interface and an implementation.
Students should be eager to write programs in languages new to them. Parts
of the course analyze basic object-oriented concepts and contrast them
with those of other languages, so familiarity with Java or a closely related
language (e.g., C#) is helpful, but not required for homework assignments.
summary: Investigate the basic concepts behind programming languages, with a strong emphasis on the techniques and benefits of functional programming. Use the programming languages ML, Racket, and Ruby in ways that will teach you how the pieces of a language fit together to create more than the sum of the parts. Gain new software skills and the concepts needed to learn new languages on your own.
title: Principles of Obesity Economics
objectives: Economics motivates consumer behavior based on preferences, relative prices,
and time and money constraints. Economics motivates the role for
government based on market failure. Obesity has been deemed a critical
public health problem. This course explores how consumer choices
lead to individuals being different weights and discusses whether there
is an economic rationale for government intervention in the markets most
closely related to food and activity choices.
prereq: An understanding of issues related to the health impacts of obesity or
some basic microeconomics is helpful but not necessary.
summary: The resources available to individuals and society and the prices of goods in the market shape our choices - even about the food we eat and the weight at which we live. This course explores the economic motivation for consumer choice and the economic role of government in markets related to obesity.
title: Planet Earth
objectives: Earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, ice ages, landslides, floods, life evolution, plate motionsall of these phenomena have interacted over the vast expanses of deep time to sculpt the dynamic planet that we live on today. Planet Earth presents an overview of our home, from a geological perspective. We learn how the elements comprising the Earth formed in the guts of stars and supernovae, how Earth and its Solar System neighbors formed from a vast cloud of gas and dust over 4.5 billion years ago. And how the atmosphere, oceans, and rocks of our planet form and change. We will emphasize how plate tectonicsthe grand unifying theory of geologyexplains how the map of our planet's surface has changed radically over geologic time, and why as present-day geologic activityincluding a variety of devastating natural disastersoccur where they do. We will also discuss the fascinating interactions and exchanges that take place among land, sea, air, and life, and how these interactions they result in the great variety of landscapesfrom deserts to glaciersthat make our planet unique, and influence climate change in the past and, potentially the future. Finally, we will delve into the processes that produce the energy and mineral resources that modern society depends on, to help understand the context of the environment and sustainability challenges that we will face in the future.
prereq: None
summary: Planet Earth, an overview of geology, discusses how earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, floods, ice ages, evolution, climate, and plate tectonics have interacted over deep time to produce a our dynamic island in space, and its unique landscapes.
title: Physics 1 for Physical Science Majors
objectives: This course is a rigorous introduction to classical mechanics, which is the study of forces and motion. How does gravity control the motion of the
planets around the sun or the motion of a projectile fired from a cannon? Why does a spinning skater spin faster when
she pulls her arms in? Why is a
perpetual motion machine impossible? These are the kinds of questions which can
be answered with classical mechanics, which was first formulated by Isaac
Newton around 1666. Classical, or Newtonian Mechanics is the oldest branch of
physics, but it will never go out of style.
It remains the foundation of our understanding of the physical world and
is constantly used by engineers and scientists. There is a space probe, called
New Horizons, that is on its way to Pluto right now, and it will arrive on July
14, 2015, exactly on time and on target, because its path has been computed
using classical mechanics, and nothing
more.
prereq: This course is aimed at freshmen engineering students and
other physical science majors at the University-level. Studetns will need a good command of algebra
and trigonometry before they start this course, and some acquaintance with
calculus. Calculus is not used much in
this course, and we will review that calculus that we do use. For the student taking this course for credit
at the University of Colorado, Calculus 1 is the co-requisite for the course;
that is, they are required to take calc1 concurrently, if they have not already
taken it. No previous knowledge of
physics is assumed, but this course is fast-paced and we cover a lot of
material, so any previous high-school physics course will be very useful.
summary: Coming in Fall 2013: This is the first semester of a 2-semester introductory physics sequence taught at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The course is intended for physical science majors and others desiring a rigorous introduction to physics. The course covers classical mechanics, including kinematics, dynamics, conservation laws, and applications.
title: Origins - Formation of the Universe, Solar System, Earth and Life
objectives: The history
of our planet and Solar System, during an interval of almost 5 billion years, is
controlled by a series of key biological and geological processes. The course
will investigate the prehistory and origins of our Solar System, the Earth and
its tectonic processes, the origin of life and the evolution of the complex
marine and terrestrial ecosystems that have uniquely defined our planet.The course
is taught by a broad range of specialists from the Natural History Museum of
Denmark, University of Copenhagen. The extensive collections at the museum will
be used throughout the course to illustrate what we know and why we know it.
prereq: The class consists mainly of short video lectures with integrated quiz questions.
summary: The Origins course tracks the origin of all things  from the Big Bang to the origin of the Solar System and the Earth. The course follows the evolution of life on our planet through deep geological time to present life forms.
title: Nutrition and Physical Activity for Health
objectives: Over 65 percent of adults and over 30 percent of children meet the classification
of being overweight or obese, and with this excess weight comes numerous
health conditions that include heart disease, diabetes, cancer, musculoskeletal
disorders, and even impairments in cognitive function. Because in most
cases the core cause of obesity and its related health conditions is a
poor quality of diet and lack of sufficient physical activity, it is no
surprise that to reverse this health problem a foundation of proper nutrition
and sufficient physical activity is imperative.This course is designed to provide a foundation of nutritional knowledge
to develop a sustainable pattern of healthy eating. To this will be added
a foundation of knowledge related to physical activity and exercise. These
two key lifestyle behaviors are then brought together under the umbrella
of calorie balance, which is the understanding of how we balance the calories
that we eat in our diet with the calories that we burn to sustain life
and to perform all of our daily tasks and functions.Ultimately, this information can only be of value if individuals understand
how to engage in these healthy behaviors within their daily lives when
they are faced with challenges and barriers. This course will address key
issues and will provide information on effective strategies for adopting
and maintaining these targeted behaviors as they apply to the adoption
and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.
prereq: There are no prerequisites for this course. However, a general background
in basic nutrition and physical activity may be helpful to the student
prior to taking this course.
summary: This course will provide a coherent, understandable look at the evidence on how nutrition and physical activity impact health through lower morbidity, longevity, and quality of life.
title: Networked Life
objectives: Networked Life looks at how our world is connected -- socially, strategically and technologically -- and why it matters.The answers to the questions above are related. They have been the subject of a fascinating intersection of disciplines, including computer science, physics, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics and finance. Researchers from these areas all strive to quantify and explain the growing complexity and connectivity of the world around us, and they have begun to develop a rich new science along the way.Networked Life will explore recent scientific efforts to explain social, economic and technological structures -- and the way these structures interact -- on many different scales, from the behavior of individuals or small groups to that of complex networks such as the Internet and the global economy.This course covers computer science topics and other material that is mathematical, but all material will be presented in a way that is accessible to an educated audience with or without a strong technical background. The majority of the course is grounded in scientific and mathematical findings of the past two decades or less (often much less).Networked Life is the flagship course of the newat the University of Pennsylvania.
prereq: 
summary: Networked Life will explore recent scientific efforts to explain social, economic and technological structures -- and the way these structures interact -- on many different scales, from the behavior of individuals or small groups to that of complex networks such as the Internet and the global economy.
title: Network Analysis in Systems Biology
objectives: The
course Network Analysis in Systems Biology provides an introduction to network
analysis and statistical methods used in contemporary Systems Biology and Systems Pharmacology research. Students will learn how to construct, analyze and
visualize different types of molecular networks, including gene regulatory
networks connecting transcription factors to their target genes,
protein-protein interaction networks, cell signaling pathways and networks,
metabolic networks, drug-target and drug-drug similarity networks and
functional association networks. Methods to process raw data from genome-wide
RNA (microarrays and RNA-seq) and proteomics (IP-MS and phosphoproteomics)
profiling will be presented. Processed data will be clustered, and gene-set
enrichment analyses methods will be covered. The course will also discuss
topics in network systems pharmacology including processing and using databases
of drug-target interactions, drug structure, drug/adverse-events, and drug
induced gene expression signatures.
prereq: Basic
courses in statistics and molecular biology are required. Courses in
bioinformatics, computer science, and physics, are not required but preferred.
Ability to write short scripts in languages such as Python would be
useful.
summary: An introduction to network analysis and statistical methods used in contemporary Systems Biology and Systems Pharmacology research. 
title: Natural Language Processing
objectives: This course covers a broad range of topics in natural language processing, including word and sentence tokenization, text classification and sentiment analysis, spelling correction, information extraction, parsing, meaning extraction, and question answering, We will also introduce the underlying theory from probability, statistics, and machine learning that are crucial for the field, and cover fundamental algorithms like n-gram language modeling, naive bayes and maxent classifiers, sequence models like Hidden Markov Models, probabilistic dependency and constituent parsing, and vector-space models of meaning.
prereq: No background in natural language processing is required. Students will be expected to know a bit of basic probability (know Bayes rule), a bit about vectors and vector spaces (could length normalize a vector), a bit of calculus (know that the derivative of a function is zero at a maximum or minimum of a function), but we will review these concepts as we first use them. You should have reasonable programming ability (know about hash tables and graph data structures), be able to write programs in Java or Python, and have a computer (Windows, Mac or Linux) with internet access.
summary: In this class, you will learn fundamental algorithms and mathematical models for processing natural language, and how these can be used to solve practical problems.
title: Nanotechnology: The Basics
objectives: Nanotechnology is an exciting research area that spans disciplines from electrical engineering to biology. Over the last two decades the basic science of this area has launched new technologies, the first examples of which are finding their way into commercial products. This eight lecture course will provide students with a birds eye view into this fast moving area and leave students with an appreciation of the importance and foundation of super small materials and devices.
prereq: 
summary: Nanotechnology is an emerging area that engages almost every technical discipline  from chemistry to computer science  in the study and application of extremely tiny materials. This short course allows any technically savvy person to go one layer beyond the surface of this broad topic to see the real substance behind the very small.
title: Modern European Mysticism and Psychological Thought
objectives: In the revival of mysticism today, mysticism has
become more psychological while psychology is increasingly interested in
mysticism. This course will provide an entry into the complex world of modern
mysticism, through studying its psychological thought. We shall begin with
exploring the interpretations of mystical experience offered by psychoanalysts
in the twentieth century, starting with Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung and ending
with contemporary thinkers such as James Hillman. However, we will see that the
European mystical traditions, including Kabbalah in the Jewish world and those
of the Catholic and Protestant worlds, developed their own elaborate systems of
psychological thought. Thus, we will mostly examine mystical psychology on its
own terms. We shall especially look at two terms that are very much in use also
in general culture: the heart (as an emotional rather than as a physical center!...)
and the soul, looking at the unique mystical concepts of their nature and destiny
and asking if there were influences and meetings between the different
religions.
prereq: 
summary: The course will examine the psychological thought of the modern mystical traditions in Europe. We shall focus on two topics with wider cultural implications: The soul and the heart.

title: Fundamentals of Digital Image and Video Processing
objectives: Digital images and videos are everywhere these days  in thousands of
scientific (e.g., astronomical, bio-medical), consumer, industrial, and
artistic applications. Moreover they come in a wide range of the
electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and
beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an
incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software
developers, and practicing scientists.
Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia
technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of
image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer
during acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car),
and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos
online, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!),
for economical storage and efficient transmission.

title: From the Repertoire: Western Music History through Performance
objectives: A survey of music history
begins with those works of music that convey the artistic trends, innovations,
and compositional techniques representative of their time. Rather than offer
a discussion of Western music focusing on a succession of composers, this course
will look at key works throughout history: from early music composed as much as a
thousand years ago, to contemporary concert music written just in the past decade. Throughinteractivehistorical presentations and performances, students will learn how Western music has developed throughout the ages into the rich and diverse
repertoire that we have today.What makes this music truly special and important?Distinguished members of the Curtis facultyTwo course presentations each
week will offer different perspectives on the same work: one that focuses on historical context and description for students with little or no prior
experience in music theory; and one that goes more in-depth into musical structure
and formal design. Students are encouraged to watch both lectures to get the
most out of the course.
prereq: 
summary: This course will focus on six important works from the Western classical-music repertoire that represent different eras and genres throughout history. We'll observe performances of this music recorded at Curtis, and our interactive discussions will explore each works historical context, musical significance, and compositional design.

title: Exploring Beethovens Piano Sonatas
objectives: Our relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. For
many musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity,
rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled
in the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to
performers. At the same time, Beethovens music is casually familiar to
millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically
inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture,
yet still represents its summit.This course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas
from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata
and an aspect of Beethovens music exemplified by it. (These might include: the
relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the
critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of
extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in
which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the
character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis
and historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a
musicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the
performer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethovens music
itself.
prereq: Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement of Accomplishment.
summary: A series of lectures on one of the greatest bodies of music ever composed, from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will explore a different facet of the music; all will attempt to locate the source of the tremendous psychological power of Beethovens music.

title: Everything is the Same: Modeling Engineered Systems
objectives: Students
 in this class will learn modeling and analysis techniques applicable to
 electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems. This systems view, 
that focuses on what is common to these different physical systems, has 
been responsible for much of the progress in the last several decades in
 aeronautics, robotics, and other engineering disciplines where there 
are many different technologies working together.Starting
 with algebraic descriptions of individual components (such as 
resistors), the class develops tools capable of predicting large-scale 
behavior of dynamic systems that evolve over time. Differential 
equations are key ingredients, so we will spend significant time 
learning how to derive differential equations from component descriptions. 
One of the key ideas in this class is that electrical, mechanical, and 
chemical systems may seem very different from each other but often have 
very similar behavior, allowing us to draw powerful analogies between 
them. Case studies from several areas of engineering will be used to 
illustrate the modeling techniques, including examples from robotics, 
power networks, drug delivery, vehicle suspension, thermal stress, and 
flexible electronics. Students will have the option of doing hands on 
experiments that demonstrate the utility of the techniques.
prereq: Familiarity with some calculus (e.g., derivatives and integrals) is required. Some exposure to linear algebra is helpful but is not required.
summary: Learn modeling and analysis techniques for electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems and discover how engineered systems that seem very different are actually very similar.

title: E-learning and Digital Cultures
objectives: E-learning and Digital Cultures is
aimed at teachers, learning technologists, and people with a general interest
in education who want to deepen their understanding of what it means to teach
and learn in the digital age. The course is about how digital cultures
intersect with learning cultures online, and how our ideas about online
education are shaped through narratives, or big stories, about the
relationship between people and technology. Well explore some of the most
engaging perspectives on digital culture in its popular and academic forms, and
well consider how our practices as teachers and learners are informed by the
difference of the digital. Well look at how learning and literacy is
represented in popular digital-, (or cyber-) culture, and explore how that
connects with the visions and initiatives we are seeing unfold in our
approaches to digital education.This course will not be taught via a
series of video lectures. Rather, a selection of rich resources will be provided
through which you can begin to engage with the themes of the course. While the
teachers will be present in the discussion forums and in various other media
environments, there will be an emphasis on learner-led group formation, and the
use of social media to build personal learning networks and communities of
peers. On this course, you will be invited to think critically and creatively
about e-learning both as a process and as a topic of study; you will be able to
try out new ideas in a supportive environment, and gain fresh perspectives on
your own experiences of teaching and learning.The course assessment will involve you
creating your own digital artefact: something that is designed to be
experienced digitally, on the web. It will be likely to contain a mixture of text,
image, sound, video, links, and can be created in the environment of your
choice. The artefact will be a representation of any of the themes encountered during the course, and youll have
the opportunity to use digital spaces in new ways to present this work. Our
definition of digital artefact is intentionally imprecise to invite
experimentation and creativity: it will be evaluated via guided peer-assessment.This course has been developed collaboratively by a team of experienced teachers and researchers in online education, who run the internationaldistance programme at the University of Edinburgh.
prereq: This course will consist of viewing short film clips alongside associated readings, as well as discussions and group collaborations among participants.
summary: This course will explore how digital cultures and learning cultures connect, and what this means for the ways in which we conduct education online. The course is not about how to do e-learning; rather, it is an invitation to view online educational practices through a particular lens  that of popular and digital culture.

human subjects. The course will explore the history and future of ethical
and policychallenges using a multi-disciplinary approach. Leading
scholars in the ethics of human subject research will serve as course faculty.
This course will introduce participants to the history that grounds
policies and debates regarding the use of humans in research. It will continue
withdiscussion ofhow current international and US policies
governing research are applied, how ethical norms and concepts have evolved,
and how, in some cases, changes in research have outpaced changes in policy,
leading to an often complicated mismatch between the two.The lead instructor isJeffrey Kahn, whois the Robert Henry
Levi and Ryda Hecht Levi Professor of Bioethics and Public Policy at the
Johns Hopkins University Berman Institute of Bioethics. He will be
joined by colleagues who are all among the leading scholars in aspects
of the ethical and policy issues related to research on human subjects,

title: Fundamentals of Digital Image and Video Processing
objectives: Digital images and videos are everywhere these days  in thousands of
scientific (e.g., astronomical, bio-medical), consumer, industrial, and
artistic applications. Moreover they come in a wide range of the
electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and
beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an
incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software
developers, and practicing scientists.
Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia
technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of
image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer
during acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car),
and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos
online, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!),
for economical storage and efficient transmission.
prereq: The course includes programming
assignments and some programming background will be helpful.
summary: In this class you will learn the basic principles and tools used to process images and videos, and how to apply them in solving practical problems of commercial and scientific interests.  
title: From the Repertoire: Western Music History through Performance
objectives: A survey of music history
begins with those works of music that convey the artistic trends, innovations,
and compositional techniques representative of their time. Rather than offer
a discussion of Western music focusing on a succession of composers, this course
will look at key works throughout history: from early music composed as much as a
thousand years ago, to contemporary concert music written just in the past decade. Throughinteractivehistorical presentations and performances, students will learn how Western music has developed throughout the ages into the rich and diverse
repertoire that we have today.What makes this music truly special and important?Distinguished members of the Curtis facultyTwo course presentations each
week will offer different perspectives on the same work: one that focuses on historical context and description for students with little or no prior
experience in music theory; and one that goes more in-depth into musical structure
and formal design. Students are encouraged to watch both lectures to get the
most out of the course.
prereq: 
summary: This course will focus on six important works from the Western classical-music repertoire that represent different eras and genres throughout history. We'll observe performances of this music recorded at Curtis, and our interactive discussions will explore each works historical context, musical significance, and compositional design.
title: Exploring Beethovens Piano Sonatas
objectives: Our relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. For
many musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity,
rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled
in the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to
performers. At the same time, Beethovens music is casually familiar to
millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically
inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture,
yet still represents its summit.This course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas
from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata
and an aspect of Beethovens music exemplified by it. (These might include: the
relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the
critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of
extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in
which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the
character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis
and historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a

title: Content Strategy for Professionals: Engaging Audiences for Your Organization
objectives: Why Content Strategy is essential for professionals in any organizationbusiness,
non-profit, or government.Content Strategy is a conversation that provides thought-leadership. It
starts a conversation with users and stakeholders inside and outside
an organization. Conversations are the natural way people think about
complex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop stories,
which lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategy
practitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises  in all departments
and sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks.In this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know that
if they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond their
job descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier
 creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that is
valued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make their
enterprise stand out.Regardless of their department, area of work, or expertise, Content Strategy
practitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile
media to interact with their most important constituents with trustable,
actionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic
content they produce enhances the audiences lives anddeepens their
understanding and engagement with the organization.Content Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but it
is done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest,
trustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports.
Often it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditional
journalism under-serves or does not reach at all. Content Strategy is not
advertising, marketing, or public relations. It is different because it
never pursues the persuasive goals that are appropriate in those disciplines.
prereq: Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement
of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.
summary: This professional Content Strategy MOOC is for people anywhere in an organization who have content development experience and now want to significantly improve their abilities to understand audiences and develop strategic words, pictures, graphics, and videos to convey their organizations most important goals.

title: Computer Vision: The Fundamentals
objectives: Computer vision seeks to develop algorithms that replicate one of the most amazing capabilities of the human brain - inferring properties of the external world purely by means of the light reflected from various objects to the eyes. We can determine how far away these objects are, how they are oriented with respect to us, and in relationship to various other objects. We reliably guess their colors and textures, and we can recognize them - this is a chair, this is my dog Fido, this is a picture of Bill Clinton smiling. We can segment out regions of space corresponding to particular objects and track them over time, such as a basketball player weaving through the court.In this course, we will study the concepts and algorithms behind some of the remarkable successes of computer vision - capabilities such as face detection, handwritten digit recognition, reconstructing three-dimensional models of cities, automated monitoring of activities, segmenting out organs or tissues in biological images, and sensing for control of robots. We will build this up from fundamentals - an understanding of the geometry and radiometry of image formation, core image processing operations, as well as tools from statistical machine learning. On completing this course a student would understand the key ideas behind the leading techniques for the main problems of computer vision - reconstruction, recognition and segmentation - and have a sense of what computers today can or cannot do.
prereq: None is required, as the lectures will be mainly self-contained. For more details and useful additional perspective, you could look at (1) Forsyth & Ponce,(2nd Edition) (2) Szeliski,.

title: Computer Vision: From 3D Reconstruction to Visual Recognition
objectives: When a 3-dimensional world is projected onto a 2-dimensional image, such as the human retina or a photograph, reconstructing back the layout and contents of the real-world becomes an ill-posed problem that is extremely difficult to solve. Humans possess the remarkable ability to navigate and understand the visual world by solving the inversion problem going from 2D to 3D. Computer Vision, a modern discipline of artificial intelligence, seeks to imitate such abilities of humans to recognize objects, navigate scenes, reconstruct layouts, and understand the geometric space and semantic meaning of the visual world. These abilities are critical in many applications including personal robotics, autonomous driving and exploration as well as photo organization, image or video retrieval and human-computer interaction.This course delivers a systematic overview of computer vision, comparable to an advanced graduate level class. We emphasize on two key issues in modeling vision: space and meaning. We begin by laying out the main problems vision needs to solve: mapping out the 3D structure of objects and scenes, recognizing objects, segmenting objects, recognizing meaning of scenes, understanding movements of humans, etc. Motivated by these important problems centered on the understanding of space and meaning, we will study the fundamental theories and important algorithms of computer vision together, starting from the analysis of 2D images, and culminating in the holistic understanding of a 3D scene
prereq: You should be able to program in at least one programming language (preferably Matlab, and/or C) and have a computer (Windows, Mac or Linux) with internet access. It also helps to have some previous exposure to basic concepts in linear algebra, probability, statistics. College level image processing, signal processing, and machine learning are a plus, but not a must.

    pregnant based on credit card receipts, or confirm the existence of the
    Higgs Boson regularly appear in Forbes, the Economist, the Wall Street
    Journal, and The New York Times. But how does one turn data into this type
    of insight? The answer is data analysis and applied statistics. Data analysis
    is the process of finding the right data to answer your question, understanding
    the processes underlying the data, discovering the important patterns in
    the data, and then communicating your results to have the biggest possible
    impact. There is a critical shortage of people with these skills in the
    workforce, which is why Hal Varian (Chief Economist at Google) says that
    being a statistician will be the sexy job for the next 10 years.This course is an applied statistics course focusing on data analysis.
    The course will begin with an overview of how to organize, perform, and
    write-up data analyses. Then we will cover some of the most popular and
    widely used statistical methods like linear regression, principal components
    analysis, cross-validation, and p-values. Instead of focusing on mathematical
    details, the lectures will be designed to help you apply these techniques
    to real data using the R statistical programming language, interpret the
    results, and diagnose potential problems in your analysis. You will also
    have the opportunity to critique and assist your fellow classmates with
    their data analyses.
prereq: The course will consist of lecture videos broken into 8-10 minute segments.

title: Clinical Problem Solving
objectives: Clinical problem solving or diagnostic reasoning is the skill that physicians use to understand a patients complaints and then to identify a short, prioritized list of possible diagnoses that could account for those complaints. This differential diagnosis then drives the choice of diagnostic tests and possible treatments. Despite striking advances in information technology, clinical problem solving has not yet been effectively replicated by computers, making it essential that clinicians work to develop expertise in this very important skill set. While television shows make this seem like a magical process, work done by cognitive psychologists and medical educators has helped us understand the ways in which expert physicians reason through these difficult problems to help their patients.This course will examine the ways physicians think about clinical problem solving and will help participants develop competence in the building blocks of clinical problem solving. The professor will use cases to illustrate different reasoning strategies and will discuss how both correct and incorrect diagnoses result from these strategies. Participants will use sample clinical cases to practice what they have learned through the lectures. Finally, the professor will discuss strategies to help students and young physicians read textbooks and articles in a way that enhances their ability to use information in the clinical environment.

title: A History of the World since 1300
objectives: This course explores the history of the modern world since Chinggis Khan. It focuses on the connections between societies from the time of the Mongol conquests and the gradual, but accelerating ways in which connections became ties of inter-dependence. The relations between societies are what will concern us. The forces pulling the world together vary from religious to economic, political to intellectual. These forces bring the world together, but they also create new divisions. Nowadays, we call this "globalization." That term has tended to emphasize the drive to worldwide integration; the view of globalization taken in this course emphasizes disintegration as well as integration. We will tackle some very basic questions: How do we explain the staggering wealth of China in the centuries up to 1750, as well as China's recent ascent? Where did the United States come from, and where is it headed? What are the significance and legacies of empire in the world? How have world wars and revolutions shaped the international system over time? What exactly is globalization, and how does today's globalization compare with the past? How has the relationship between humans and nature changed over the centuries?
prereq: Anyone and everyone is welcome to take this class.
summary: This course will examine the ways in which the world has grown more integrated yet more divided over the past 700 years.

happens when software runs  and that this question can be answered at
several levels of abstraction, including the hardware architecture level,
the assembly level, the C programming level and the Java programming level.
The core around which the course is built is C, assembly, and low-level
data representation, but this is connected to higher levels (roughly how
basic Java could be implemented), lower levels (the general structure of
a processor and the memory hierarchy), and the role of the operating system
(but not how the operating system is implemented).
prereq: Introductory programming in C or Java.

    environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.
    These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical
    and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through
    multiple "mini-projects" in Python. To make this class enjoyable,
    these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack,
    and Asteroids. When youve finished our course, we cant promise
    that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will
    learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while youre doing
    it.

title: Understanding Einstein: The Special Theory of Relativity
objectives: In this course we will seek to understand Einstein, especially focusing
on the special theory of relativity that Albert Einstein, as a 26-year-old
patent clerk, introduced in his so-called miracle year of 1905. Our goal
will be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations
of relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein
the person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his
theory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein
come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the
meaning of relativity? Whats special about the special theory of relativity?
Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean
to say that time is the fourth dimension? Can time actually run more
slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending
on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why cant things
travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the
center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence
that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why
didnt Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?Students may choose one of three approaches to the course: a more quantitative
approach, a more qualitative approach, or an auditing approach. The more
quantitative approach will include weekly problem sets, while the more
qualitative approach will include a creative project relating to the young
Einstein and/or the special theory of relativity.
prereq: No prior knowledge is required. Anyone who is willing to engage with the
material is welcome. (For students choosing the more quantitative approach,
a familiarity with basic algebra will be helpful. But a brief math review
will be provided.)
summary: This course offers you the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the life and work of the young Albert Einstein and especially his mind-bending special theory of relativity.

title: Probabilistic Graphical Models
objectives: Uncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future, and even in the present and the past, many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.

objectives: We make economics
decisions every day: what to buy, whether to work or play, what to
study. We respond to markets all the time: prices influence our
decisions, markets signal where to put effort, they direct firms to
produce certain goods over others. Economics is all around us.This
course is a rigorous introduction to the microeconomic theory of
markets: why we have them, how they work, what they accomplish. We
will explore what outcomes they generate when they work well
and what happens when they do not. We will learn why governments are
important and when regulation and intervention is necessary. Examples
are taken from everyday life, from goods and services that we all
purchase and use. We will apply the theory to current events and
policy debates through weekly exercises. These will empower you to be
an educated, critical thinker who can understand, analyze and
evaluate market outcomes.
prereq: Economics requires thinking in three
languages: words, graph and mathematical notation. All concepts
are introduced slowly and gradually, but comfort with thinking
analytically will be helpful.

objectives: Calculus is about the very large, the very small, and how things change. The surprise is that something seemingly so abstract ends up explaining the real world. Calculus plays a starring role in the biological, physical, and social sciences. By focusing outside of the classroom, we will see examples of calculus appearing in daily life.This course is a first andfriendly introduction to calculus, suitable for someone who has never seen the subject before, or for someone who has seen some calculus but wants to review the concepts and practice applying those concepts to solve problems. One learns calculus by doing calculus, and so this course encourages you to participate by providing you with:
prereq: If you already know some calculus, you might consider the more advanced course by UPenn's Robert Ghrist, available atIf you are concerned about the background needed to begin calculus, you might consider the pre-calculus course by UCI's Sarah Eichhorn, available at
summary: Calculus One is a first introduction to differential and integral calculus, emphasizing engaging examples from everyday life.
title: Algebra
objectives: This course is taught so that students will acquire a solid foundation 
in algebra. Emphasis is placed on understanding 
the properties of linear, polynomial and rational functions, including 
inequalities and complex numbers. Students will learn to work with 
various types of functions in symbolic, graphical, numerical and verbal 
form.
prereq: High school algebra and geometry are recommended.
summary: This course is taught so that students will acquire a solid foundation in algebra. The course concentrates on the various functions that are important to the study of calculus.
title: A History of the World since 1300
objectives: This course explores the history of the modern world since Chinggis Khan. It focuses on the connections between societies from the time of the Mongol conquests and the gradual, but accelerating ways in which connections became ties of inter-dependence. The relations between societies are what will concern us. The forces pulling the world together vary from religious to economic, political to intellectual. These forces bring the world together, but they also create new divisions. Nowadays, we call this "globalization." That term has tended to emphasize the drive to worldwide integration; the view of globalization taken in this course emphasizes disintegration as well as integration. We will tackle some very basic questions: How do we explain the staggering wealth of China in the centuries up to 1750, as well as China's recent ascent? Where did the United States come from, and where is it headed? What are the significance and legacies of empire in the world? How have world wars and revolutions shaped the international system over time? What exactly is globalization, and how does today's globalization compare with the past? How has the relationship between humans and nature changed over the centuries?
prereq: Anyone and everyone is welcome to take this class.
summary: This course will examine the ways in which the world has grown more integrated yet more divided over the past 700 years.
title: The Hardware/Software Interface
objectives: This course examines key computational abstraction levels below modern
high-level languages; number representation, assembly language, introduction
to C, memory management, the operating-system process model, high-level
machine architecture including the memory hierarchy, and how high-level
languages are implemented. We will develop students sense of what really
happens when software runs  and that this question can be answered at
several levels of abstraction, including the hardware architecture level,
the assembly level, the C programming level and the Java programming level.
The core around which the course is built is C, assembly, and low-level
data representation, but this is connected to higher levels (roughly how
basic Java could be implemented), lower levels (the general structure of
a processor and the memory hierarchy), and the role of the operating system
(but not how the operating system is implemented).
prereq: Introductory programming in C or Java.
summary: Examines key computational abstraction levels below modern high-level languages. From Java/C to assembly programming, to basic processor and system organization.
title: Healthcare Innovation and Entrepreneurship

All students will gain confidence in the basic elements of the initial discovery phase in the healthcare innovation process, including
prereq: Students should have an appreciation for healthcare and its challenges, but otherwise there are no prerequisites for the course.
summary: This interdisciplinary course focuses on sustainable innovation, introducing entrepreneurial students to the realities of problem identification and solution design within the complex world of healthcare.
title: An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python
objectives: This course is designed to help students with very little or no computing
    background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.
    Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer
    language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera.
    To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming
    environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.
    These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical
    and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through
    multiple "mini-projects" in Python. To make this class enjoyable,
    these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack,
    and Asteroids. When youve finished our course, we cant promise
    that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will
    learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while youre doing
    it.
prereq: High school mathematics
summary: This course is designed to be a fun introduction to the basics of programming in Python. Our main focus will be on building simple interactive games such as Pong, Blackjack and Asteroids.
title: Understanding Einstein: The Special Theory of Relativity
objectives: In this course we will seek to understand Einstein, especially focusing
on the special theory of relativity that Albert Einstein, as a 26-year-old
patent clerk, introduced in his so-called miracle year of 1905. Our goal
will be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations
of relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein
the person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his
theory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein
come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the
meaning of relativity? Whats special about the special theory of relativity?
Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean
to say that time is the fourth dimension? Can time actually run more
slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending
on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why cant things
travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the
center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence
that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why
didnt Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?Students may choose one of three approaches to the course: a more quantitative
approach, a more qualitative approach, or an auditing approach. The more
quantitative approach will include weekly problem sets, while the more
qualitative approach will include a creative project relating to the young
Einstein and/or the special theory of relativity.
prereq: No prior knowledge is required. Anyone who is willing to engage with the
material is welcome. (For students choosing the more quantitative approach,
a familiarity with basic algebra will be helpful. But a brief math review
will be provided.)
summary: This course offers you the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the life and work of the young Albert Einstein and especially his mind-bending special theory of relativity. 
title: Probabilistic Graphical Models
objectives: Uncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future, and even in the present and the past, many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.
prereq: 
summary: In this class, you will learn the basics of the PGM representation and how to construct them, using both human knowledge and machine learning techniques.
title: Principles of Microeconomics
objectives: We make economics
decisions every day: what to buy, whether to work or play, what to
study. We respond to markets all the time: prices influence our
decisions, markets signal where to put effort, they direct firms to
produce certain goods over others. Economics is all around us.This
course is a rigorous introduction to the microeconomic theory of
markets: why we have them, how they work, what they accomplish. We
will explore what outcomes they generate when they work well
and what happens when they do not. We will learn why governments are
important and when regulation and intervention is necessary. Examples
are taken from everyday life, from goods and services that we all
purchase and use. We will apply the theory to current events and
policy debates through weekly exercises. These will empower you to be
an educated, critical thinker who can understand, analyze and
evaluate market outcomes.
prereq: Economics requires thinking in three
languages: words, graph and mathematical notation. All concepts
are introduced slowly and gradually, but comfort with thinking
analytically will be helpful.
summary: Learn how markets work, what they accomplish well and what their limitations are.
title: Microeconomics Principles
objectives: 
prereq: Knowledge of elementary algebra.
summary: Introduction to the functions of individual decision-makers, both consumers and producers, within the larger economic system. Primary emphasis on the nature and functions of product markets, the theory of the firm under varying conditions of competition and monopoly, and the role of government in promoting efficiency in the economy.

title: Social and Economic Networks:  Models and Analysis
objectives: Social networks pervade our social and economic lives.  They play a central role in the transmission of information about job opportunities and are critical to the trade of many goods and services. They are important in determining which products we buy, which languages we speak, how we vote, as well as whether or not we decide to become criminals, how much education we obtain, and our likelihood of succeeding professionally.  The countless ways in which network structures affect our well-being make it critical to understand how social network structures impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do. This course provides an overview and synthesis of research on social and economic networks, drawing on studies by sociologists, economists, computer scientists, physicists, and mathematicians.The course begins with some empirical background onsocial and economic networks, and an overview of concepts used todescribe and measure networks.  Next, we will cover a set ofmodels of how networks form, including random network models as well asstrategic formation models, and some hybrids.  We will then discuss a series ofmodels of how networks impact behavior, including contagion, diffusion, learning, and peer influences.
prereq: The course has some basic prerequisites in mathematics and statistics. For example, it will be assumed that students are comfortable with basic concepts from linear algebra (e.g., matrix multiplication), probability theory (e.g., probability distributions, expected values, Bayes' rule), and statistics (e.g., hypothesis testing), and some light calculus (e.g., differentiation and integration). Beyond those concepts, the course will be self-contained.
summary: Learn how to model social and economic networks and their impact on human behavior.  How do networks form, why do they exhibit certain patterns, and how does their structure impact diffusion, learning, and other behaviors?   We will bring together models and techniques from economics, sociology, math, physics, statistics and computer science to answer these questions.

title: Synapses, Neurons and Brains 
objectives: Probably the greatest challenge of the 21st century of the brain is
    to understand how subcellular and cellular neuronal processes give rise
    to behavior  movement, perception, emotions, memory and creativity. This
    course will discuss, step-by-step, how modern molecular, optical, electrical,
    anatomical and theoretical methods have provided fascinating insights into
    the operation of the elementary building blocks of brains and, most importantly,
    how neuronal mechanisms underlie memory and learning processes. We will
    next discuss why computer simulations are so essential for understanding
    both neuronal life ware and the emergence of networks dynamics (e.g.,
    as in the Blue Brain Project).The course will start by highlighting a few recent brain-excitements,
    including treating the sick brain via electrical stimulation, recent attempts
    at reading the brain code for brain-machine interfaces, new neuro-anatomical
    techniques (Brainbow and connectomics) and physiological methods (optogenetics)
    that enables us to record/activate the living, behaving brain at single
    cell resolution. We will end by discussing emerging frontiers in brain
    research, including the interaction between brain research and the arts.
    As an added bonus, a lecture on perception, action, cognition and emotions
    will be taught by an acclaimed neuroscientists, Prof. Israel Nelken..
prereq: No background is required.
summary: You will become intimately acquainted with the operational principles of neuronal life-ware (synapses, neurons and the networks that they form) as well as with recent ideas about how the dynamics of these networks generate the neuronal code.

url: https://www.coursera.org/course/macroeconomics
title: Principles of Macroeconomics
objectives: In this course,
we will examine the main bodies of economic theory that have been used to guide
economists and policy makers understanding of the macroeconomy. Macroeconomics
is a word derived from the Greek prefix makros, meaning large. It is the study
of economic aggregates, of national and international economies and of the
economic management role played by governments and international organisations.The founder of
modern macroeconomics, the British economist John Maynard Keynes, famously wrote
The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right
and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed,
the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be
quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some
defunct economist. This will be the key theme we explore in the course, the
influence of theory and the way that policy responses to events like recession,
unemployment, inflation and the Global Financial Crisis, reflect that theory.We will cover
important macroeconomic concepts such as the national accounts, unemployment
and inflation, explain how the ideas associated with John Maynard Keynes laid
the foundation for governments active management of the macroeconomy in the
post war era, and examine the intellectual basis for the monetary and fiscal
policy responses to the Global Financial Crisis. Economists approaches to the analysis of
long run economic growth will also be considered. The approach will be
critical. There are few areas of human endeavour that attract so much debate
and disagreement as the management of a modern industrial economy. We will not
shy away from those debates. But what we will do is emphasise the systematic
theorising that underlies the way macroeconomists and policy makers approach
their task. The aim is to enable those who take the course to become informed
analysts of the macroeconomy and of current (and past) macroeconomic policy
debates.
prereq: 
summary:  All of us are affected by macroeconomic forces  they shape the very world we live in. And governments all around the world try to shape those forces in ways that (hopefully) improve the lives of their constituents. In this subject, we will examine the major theories used by macro economists to analyse national economies and the international economy.

title: Surviving Disruptive Technologies
objectives: The purpose of this course is to help individuals and organizations
survive when confronted with disruptive technologies that threaten their
current way of life. We will look at a
general model of survival and use it to analyze companies and industries that
have failed or are close to failing. Examples
of companies that have not survived include Kodak, a firm over 100 years old,
Blockbuster and Borders. It is likely
that each of us has done business with all of these firms, and today Kodak and
Blockbuster are in bankruptcy and Borders has been liquidated. Disruptions are impacting industries like
education; Coursera and others offering these massive open online courses are a
challenge for Universities. In addition
to firms that have failed, we will look at some that have survived and are
doing well. What are their strategies
for survival?By highlighting the reasons for the decline of firms and
industries, participants can begin to understand how to keep the same thing
from happening to them. Through the
study of successful organizations, we will try to tease out approaches to
disruptions that actually work. Our
ultimate objective is to develop a strategy for survival in a world confronting
one disruptive technology after another.

It is hoped that students in developing or prospective democracies will use the theories, ideas, and lessons in the class to help build or improve democracy in their own countries.
title: Statistics: Making Sense of Data
objectives: We live in a world where data are increasingly available, in ever larger quantities, and are increasingly expected to form the basis for decisions by governments, businesses, and other organizations, as well as by individuals in their daily lives. To cope effectively, every informed citizen must be statistically literate.This course will provide an intuitive introduction to applied statistical reasoning, introducing fundamental statistical skills and acquainting students with the full process of inquiry and evaluation used in investigations in a wide range of fields. In particular, the course will cover methods of data collection, constructing effective graphical and numerical displays to understand the data, how to estimate and describe the error in estimates of some important quantities, and the key ideas in how statistical tests can be used to separate significant differences from those that are only a reflection of the natural variability in data.
prereq: Students should be comfortable with basic high-school-level mathematics.
summary: This course is an introduction to the key ideas and principles
of the collection, display, and analysis of data to guide you in making
valid and appropriate conclusions about the world.
title: Social and Economic Networks:  Models and Analysis
objectives: Social networks pervade our social and economic lives.  They play a central role in the transmission of information about job opportunities and are critical to the trade of many goods and services. They are important in determining which products we buy, which languages we speak, how we vote, as well as whether or not we decide to become criminals, how much education we obtain, and our likelihood of succeeding professionally.  The countless ways in which network structures affect our well-being make it critical to understand how social network structures impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do. This course provides an overview and synthesis of research on social and economic networks, drawing on studies by sociologists, economists, computer scientists, physicists, and mathematicians.The course begins with some empirical background onsocial and economic networks, and an overview of concepts used todescribe and measure networks.  Next, we will cover a set ofmodels of how networks form, including random network models as well asstrategic formation models, and some hybrids.  We will then discuss a series ofmodels of how networks impact behavior, including contagion, diffusion, learning, and peer influences.
prereq: The course has some basic prerequisites in mathematics and statistics. For example, it will be assumed that students are comfortable with basic concepts from linear algebra (e.g., matrix multiplication), probability theory (e.g., probability distributions, expected values, Bayes' rule), and statistics (e.g., hypothesis testing), and some light calculus (e.g., differentiation and integration). Beyond those concepts, the course will be self-contained.
summary: Learn how to model social and economic networks and their impact on human behavior.  How do networks form, why do they exhibit certain patterns, and how does their structure impact diffusion, learning, and other behaviors?   We will bring together models and techniques from economics, sociology, math, physics, statistics and computer science to answer these questions.  
title: Scientific Computing

summary: Investigate the flexibility and power of project-oriented computational analysis, and enhance communication of information by creating visual representations of scientific data.
title: Introduction to Logic
objectives: Logic is one of the oldest intellectual disciplines in human history.
    It dates back to the times of Aristotle; it has been studied through the
    centuries; and it is still a subject of active investigation today.This course is a basic introduction to Logic. It shows how to formalize
    information in form of logical sentences. It shows how to reason systematically
    with this information to produce all logical conclusions and only logical
    conclusions. And it examines logic technology and its applications - in
    mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.The course differs from other introductory courses in Logic in two important
    ways. First of all, it teaches a novel theory of logic that improves accessibility
    while preserving rigor. Second, the material is laced with interactive
    demonstrations and exercises that suggest the many practical applications
    of the field.
prereq: 
summary: In this course, you will learn how to formalize information and reason systematically to produce logical conclusions. We will also examine logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.
title: Gamification
objectives: Gamification is the application of digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such as business and social impact challenges. Video games are the dominant entertainment form of our time because they are powerful tools for motivating behavior. Effective games leverage both psychology and technology, in ways that can be applied outside the immersive environments of games themselves. Gamification as a business practice has exploded over the past two years. Organizations are applying it in areas such as marketing, human resources, productivity enhancement, sustainability, training, health and wellness, innovation, and customer engagement. Game thinking means more than just dropping in badges and leaderboards; it requires a thoughtful understanding of motivation and design techniques. This course examines the mechanisms of gamification and provides an understanding of its effective use.
prereq: This course is designed as an introduction to gamification as a business practice. No particular technical knowledge or prior coursework are required.
summary: Gamification is the application of game elements and digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such as business and social impact challenges. This course will teach you the mechanisms of gamification, why it has such tremendous potential, and how to use it effectively.
title: Computational Methods for Data Analysis

spectral analysis, filtering methods, principal component analysis, orthogonal
mode decomposition, and image processing and compression.
prereq: 
summary: Exploratory and objective data analysis methods applied to the physical, engineering, and biological sciences.

title: Synapses, Neurons and Brains
objectives: Probably the greatest challenge of the 21st century of the brain is
    to understand how subcellular and cellular neuronal processes give rise
    to behavior  movement, perception, emotions, memory and creativity. This
    course will discuss, step-by-step, how modern molecular, optical, electrical,
    anatomical and theoretical methods have provided fascinating insights into
    the operation of the elementary building blocks of brains and, most importantly,
    how neuronal mechanisms underlie memory and learning processes. We will
    next discuss why computer simulations are so essential for understanding
    both neuronal life ware and the emergence of networks dynamics (e.g.,
    as in the Blue Brain Project).The course will start by highlighting a few recent brain-excitements,
    including treating the sick brain via electrical stimulation, recent attempts
    at reading the brain code for brain-machine interfaces, new neuro-anatomical
    techniques (Brainbow and connectomics) and physiological methods (optogenetics)
    that enables us to record/activate the living, behaving brain at single
    cell resolution. We will end by discussing emerging frontiers in brain
    research, including the interaction between brain research and the arts.
    As an added bonus, a lecture on perception, action, cognition and emotions
    will be taught by an acclaimed neuroscientists, Prof. Israel Nelken..
prereq: No background is required.
summary: You will become intimately acquainted with the operational principles of neuronal life-ware (synapses, neurons and the networks that they form) as well as with recent ideas about how the dynamics of these networks generate the neuronal code.  As an aperitif we will highlight present brain-excitements and for dessert we will discuss the future of brain research

title: Principles of Macroeconomics
objectives: In this course,
we will examine the main bodies of economic theory that have been used to guide
economists and policy makers understanding of the macroeconomy. Macroeconomics
is a word derived from the Greek prefix makros, meaning large. It is the study
of economic aggregates, of national and international economies and of the
economic management role played by governments and international organisations.The founder of
modern macroeconomics, the British economist John Maynard Keynes, famously wrote
The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right
and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed,
the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be
quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some
defunct economist. This will be the key theme we explore in the course, the
influence of theory and the way that policy responses to events like recession,
unemployment, inflation and the Global Financial Crisis, reflect that theory.We will cover
important macroeconomic concepts such as the national accounts, unemployment
and inflation, explain how the ideas associated with John Maynard Keynes laid
the foundation for governments active management of the macroeconomy in the
post war era, and examine the intellectual basis for the monetary and fiscal
policy responses to the Global Financial Crisis. Economists approaches to the analysis of
long run economic growth will also be considered. The approach will be
critical. There are few areas of human endeavour that attract so much debate
and disagreement as the management of a modern industrial economy. We will not
shy away from those debates. But what we will do is emphasise the systematic
theorising that underlies the way macroeconomists and policy makers approach
their task. The aim is to enable those who take the course to become informed
analysts of the macroeconomy and of current (and past) macroeconomic policy
debates.
prereq: 
summary:  All of us are affected by macroeconomic forces  they shape the very world we live in. And governments all around the world try to shape those forces in ways that (hopefully) improve the lives of their constituents. In this subject, we will examine the major theories used by macro economists to analyse national economies and the international economy. 
title: Human-Computer Interaction
objectives: In this course, you will learn how to design technologies that bring people
joy, rather than frustration. You'll learn several techniques for rapidly
prototyping and evaluating multiple interface alternatives -- and why rapid
prototyping and comparative evaluation are essential to excellent interaction
design. You'll learn how to conduct fieldwork with people to help you get
design ideas. How to make paper prototypes and low-fidelity mock-ups that
are interactive -- and how to use these designs to get feedback from other
stakeholders like your teammates, clients, and users. You'll learn principles
of visual design so that you can effectively organize and present information
with your interfaces. You'll learn principles of perception and cognition
that inform effective interaction design. And you'll learn how to perform
and analyze controlled experiments online. In many cases, we'll use Web
design as the anchoring domain. A lot of the examples will come from the
Web, and we'll talk just a bit about Web technologies in particular. When
we do so, it will be to support the main goal of this course, which is
helping you build human-centered design skills, so that you have the principles
and methods to create excellent interfaces with any technology.
prereq: 
summary: Helping you build human-centered design skills, so that you have the principles and methods to create excellent interfaces with any technology.
title: Analytic Combinatorics, Part II
objectives: Analytic Combinatorics is based on formal methods for deriving functional relationships on generating functions and asymptotic analysis treating those functions as functions in the complex plane.Part II covers the symbolic method for defining generating functions immediately from combinatorial constructions, then develops methods for directly deriving asymptotic results from those generating functions, using complex asymptotics, singularity analysis, saddle-point asymptotics, and limit laws.The course teaches the precept "if you can specify it, you can analyze it".
prereq: You need basic familiarity with programming in Java and the algorithms and data structures from Algorithms,, or equivalent experience/preparation in math and CS.
summary: This course teaches a calculus that enables precise quantitative predictions of large combinatorial structures.Part II introduces the symbolic method to derive functional relations among ordinary, exponential, and multivariate generating functions, and methods in complex analysis for deriving accurate asymptotics from the GF equations.
title: Surviving Disruptive Technologies
objectives: The purpose of this course is to help individuals and organizations
survive when confronted with disruptive technologies that threaten their
current way of life. We will look at a
general model of survival and use it to analyze companies and industries that
have failed or are close to failing. Examples
of companies that have not survived include Kodak, a firm over 100 years old,
Blockbuster and Borders. It is likely
that each of us has done business with all of these firms, and today Kodak and
Blockbuster are in bankruptcy and Borders has been liquidated. Disruptions are impacting industries like
education; Coursera and others offering these massive open online courses are a
challenge for Universities. In addition
to firms that have failed, we will look at some that have survived and are
doing well. What are their strategies
for survival?By highlighting the reasons for the decline of firms and
industries, participants can begin to understand how to keep the same thing
from happening to them. Through the
study of successful organizations, we will try to tease out approaches to
disruptions that actually work. Our
ultimate objective is to develop a strategy for survival in a world confronting
one disruptive technology after another.
prereq: 
summary:  The purpose of this course is to help participants and the organizations they encounter survive the waves of technological disruptions facing business, government, education and their daily lives.
title: Passion Driven Statistics
objectives: In this project-based course, you will have the opportunity to answer a question that you feel passionately about through independent research based on existing data. Students will have the opportunity to develop skills in generating testable hypotheses, preparing data for analysis, conducting descriptive and inferential statistical analyses, and presenting research findings.
prereq: No background required. All are welcome.
summary: With existing data, you will develop skills in data analysis and basic statistics by exploring your own research question.
title: Learn to Program: Crafting Quality Code
objectives: Most programs are used for years and are worked on by many people. Having programs that are easy to understand is essential, in the same way that a well-organized essay is far easier to follow than a disorganized one. Well show you an approach that helps to break down problems into smaller tasks that are easier to both solve and read.This design approach also makes it more straightforward to find and fix flaws. You'll be introduced to the tools that professional programmers use; they're called "testing" and "debugging".For most complex problems, there are many programs that solve them. Some are inherently slower than others. You'll learn how to read two programs and compare them for efficiency.
prereq: We are writing a textbook that matches the course material closely, and includes different examples and exercises than the ones you'll encounter in this course.  It also covers the same course material as presented in Learn to Program: The Fundamentals.This title is currently available in Beta. Buy the eBook now, and you'll be able to download successive releases of the eBook as we add material and correct mistakes. You'll get the final eBook when the book is finished.  If you want more reading and practice before LTP2 starts on 25 March, this book is an excellent way to get it. You can choose to purchase an electronic version (PDF, ePub, mobi) as well as a paper book.You can visit the Contents/extracts tab forto see the progress; any chapter that lists subsections is included in the Beta.
summary: Not all programs are created equal. In this course, we'll focus on writing quality code that runs correctly and efficiently. We'll design, code and validate our programs and learn how to compare programs that are addressing the same task.

title: Introduction to Psychology as a Science
objectives: Since we were young children, we have tried to understand, to predict,
and to control behavior. We first dealt with our parents and teachers,
and later our friends and companions. This course shows, however,
how the understanding, prediction, and control of behavior require scientific
validation. By using tools that are systematic and objective, psychology
has learned how people behave and think.Psychology is a very broad field of study and the course will include
discussions of the brain and nervous system, sensation and perception,
learning, memory, intelligence and thinking, lifespan development, emotion
and motivation, personality, social behavior, behavioral disorders, and
psychological treatment of disorders. The course will include short
lecture modules, demonstrations and experiments, and writing assignments.
prereq: The class will consist of on-line lecture videos, which are between 10
and 12 minutes in length. These contain 1-2 integrated quiz questions per
video. There will also be standalone homeworks that are not part of video
lectures, science experiment demonstrations, and a (not optional) final
exam.
summary: Learn about how psychology has developed a body of knowledge about behavior and mind through the use of scientific methods.  All areas of psychology will be covered.

title: Health Policy and the Affordable Care Act
objectives: The American health care system has many problems. 50 million people are uninsured. Quality is extremely uneven, with peaks of greatness at leading academic centers but overall poor quality in both process measures and outcomes such as asthma deaths. Finally, the U.S. health care system spends over $8000 per patient per year, nearly double the next highest country. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Over the next decade or more, the Act will dramatically re-structure the American health care system.This course will explore the history and structure of the current American health care system, including the history of and problems with employment-based health insurance, the challenges surrounding access, cost and quality, and the medical malpractice conundrum. The course will then explore the history of health care reform and the challenges that were overcome to achieve health reform in America. Finally, we will delineate the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act improves access and quality, and will control costs. Throughout lessons regarding health economics, health policy, and medical practice will be elucidated.This class is open to anyone that is interested in gaining a better understanding of the US health care system and the challenges of health care reform. There are no prerequisites or required knowledge of the health system.
prereq: No background is required; all are welcome.
summary: This course will explore the many problems of the American health care system and discuss the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act will impact access, quality, costs, as well as medical innovation.

title: Functional Programming Principles in Scala
objectives: This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code thats safe, concise, and elegant. Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for todays and tomorrows multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions.Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Klout.In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically.The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, most of which are also programming projects.
prereq: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient.
summary: Learn about functional programming, and how it can be effectively combined with object-oriented programming. Gain practice in writing clean functional code, using the Scala programming language.

title: Exploring Quantum Physics
objectives: Quantum
physics is the foundation for much of modern technology, provides the framework
for understanding light and matter from the subatomic to macroscopic domains,
and makes possible the most precise measurements ever made. More than just a theory, it offers a way of
looking at the world that grows richer with experience and practice. Our course will provide some of that practice and teach 
you "tricks of the trade" (not found in textbooks) that will enable you 
to solve quantum-mechanical problems yourself and understand the subject
 at a deeper level.The
basic principles of quantum physics are actually quite simple, but they lead to
astonishing outcomes. Two examples that
we will look at from various perspectives are the prediction of the laser by
Albert Einstein in 1917 and the prediction of antimatter by Paul Dirac in 1928. Both of these predictions came from very
simple arguments in quantum theory, and led to results that transformed science
and society. Another familiar
phenomenon, magnetism, had been known since antiquity, but only with the advent
of quantum physics was it understood how magnets worked, to a degree that made
possible the discovery in the 1980s of ultrastrong rare-earth magnets. However, lasers, antimatter and magnets are
areas of vibrant research, and they are all encountered in the new field of
ultracold atomic physics that will provide much of the material of Exploring
Quantum Physics.Richard
Feynman once said, I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum
mechanics. We say, thats no reason not
to try! What Feynman was referring to are some of the spooky phenomena like quantum entanglement, which are incomprehensible from the standpoint of classical physics. Even though they have been thoroughly tested by experiment, and are even being exploited for applications such as cryptography and logic processing, they still seem so counterintuitive that they give rise to extraordinary ideas such as the many-world theory. Quantum physics combines
a spectacular record of discovery and predictive success, with foundational
perplexities so severe that even Albert Einstein came to believe that it was
wrong. This is what makes it such an
exciting area of science!
prereq: The purpose of this course is to provide a 
graduate/advanced undergraduate level introduction to quantum 
mechanics. The emphasis throughout the course will be on applications 
of general techniques to specific quantum-mechanical problems and 
phenomena. Basic understanding of calculus and linear algebra is 
essential for completing this course, and knowledge of differential 
equations and Fourier transforms is valuable. Previous exposure to 
quantum mechanics would be helpful, but is not assumed. The course will 
be self-contained and an introduction will be provided.
summary: An introduction to quantum physics with emphasis on topics at the frontiers of research, and developing understanding through exercise.

title: Computational Photography
objectives: The goal of this course is to introduce you to the basics of how computation
has impacted the entire workflow of photography (i.e., from how images
are captured, manipulated and collaborated on, and shared).The course begins with a conceptualization ofphotography as drawing
with light and the capturing of light to form images/videos. You
will learn about and understand how the optics and the sensor within a
camera are generalized, as well as learn about and understand how the lighting
and other aspects of the environment are also generalized through computation
to capture novel images.Pre- and post-processing techniques used to manipulate and improve images
will be discussed. Activities in this course are selected to give
you first hand experience with the power of the web and the Internet for
both analyzing and sharing images.This course is interdisciplinary and draws upon concepts and principles
from computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, mathematics
and optics.We look forward to your engagement and participation with both the course
and its discussion forums.Denis Lantsman is the TA for the class. Denis is a graduate of Harvey

title: Introduction to Mathematical Thinking
objectives: The goal of the course is to help you develop a valuable mental ability  a powerful way of thinking that our ancestors have developed over three thousand years.Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics  at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box  a valuable ability in todays world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.The primary audience is first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. They will need mathematical thinking to succeed in their major. Because mathematical thinking is a valuable life skill, however, anyone over the age of 17 could benefit from taking the course.
prereq: High school mathematics.

title: How Things Work 1
objectives: Designed for non-science students, this course is a practical 
introduction to physics and science in everyday life. It considers 
objects from the world around us, identifying and exploring the 
scientific concepts upon which they're based. Because it starts with 
objects and looks within them for science, it is the reverse of a 
traditional physics class. Instead of the usual principle-driven physics
 class, How Things Work is case-study physics. In this pilot semester of
 How Things Work, we will explore the basic laws of motion in the 
context of six familiar objects or activities: (1) Skating, (2) Falling 
Balls, (3) Ramps, (4) Seesaws, (5) Wheels, and (6) Bumper Cars. Despite 
their simplicity, these topics will bring us in contact with some of the
 most important concepts in physics, including inertia, energy, and 
momentum.

title: Chemistry: Concept Development and Application
objectives: This course will cover an introduction to the atomic molecular structure of matter, similar to a typical first semester General Chemistry course. The fundamental concepts will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach developed at Rice University and utilizing a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rices Connexions project. In this approach, rather than simply telling you the concepts you need to know and then asking you to memorize them or apply them, we will develop these concepts from experimental observations and scientific reasoning. There are several reasons for using this approach. One reason is that most of us our inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there. Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive. When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes. This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes. A third reason is that this is simply more interesting. The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning. It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.
prereq: The class can be taken by someone with no prior experience in chemistry. However, some prior familiarity with the basics of chemistry is desirable as we will cover some elements only briefly. For example, a prior high school chemistry class would be helpful.

url: https://www.coursera.org/course/musicproduction
title: Introduction to Music Production
objectives: With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge,dedication, and creativity.Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use. Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing.We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process.Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide.After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing boarda very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication.In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.
prereq: You should be able to perform the following tasks in a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), such as GarageBand, Pro Tools, Logic, Live, Reason, SONAR, or Digital Performer:
summary: Learn about the music production processincluding recording, editing, and mixingand the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer.

title: Introduction to Psychology as a Science
objectives: Since we were young children, we have tried to understand, to predict,
and to control behavior. We first dealt with our parents and teachers,
and later our friends and companions. This course shows, however,
how the understanding, prediction, and control of behavior require scientific
validation. By using tools that are systematic and objective, psychology
has learned how people behave and think.Psychology is a very broad field of study and the course will include
discussions of the brain and nervous system, sensation and perception,
learning, memory, intelligence and thinking, lifespan development, emotion
and motivation, personality, social behavior, behavioral disorders, and
psychological treatment of disorders. The course will include short
lecture modules, demonstrations and experiments, and writing assignments.
prereq: The class will consist of on-line lecture videos, which are between 10
and 12 minutes in length. These contain 1-2 integrated quiz questions per
video. There will also be standalone homeworks that are not part of video
lectures, science experiment demonstrations, and a (not optional) final
exam.
summary: Learn about how psychology has developed a body of knowledge about behavior and mind through the use of scientific methods.  All areas of psychology will be covered.
title: Health Policy and the Affordable Care Act
objectives: The American health care system has many problems. 50 million people are uninsured. Quality is extremely uneven, with peaks of greatness at leading academic centers but overall poor quality in both process measures and outcomes such as asthma deaths. Finally, the U.S. health care system spends over $8000 per patient per year, nearly double the next highest country. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Over the next decade or more, the Act will dramatically re-structure the American health care system.This course will explore the history and structure of the current American health care system, including the history of and problems with employment-based health insurance, the challenges surrounding access, cost and quality, and the medical malpractice conundrum. The course will then explore the history of health care reform and the challenges that were overcome to achieve health reform in America. Finally, we will delineate the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act improves access and quality, and will control costs. Throughout lessons regarding health economics, health policy, and medical practice will be elucidated.This class is open to anyone that is interested in gaining a better understanding of the US health care system and the challenges of health care reform. There are no prerequisites or required knowledge of the health system.
prereq: No background is required; all are welcome.
summary: This course will explore the many problems of the American health care system and discuss the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act will impact access, quality, costs, as well as medical innovation.
title: Functional Programming Principles in Scala
objectives: This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code thats safe, concise, and elegant. Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for todays and tomorrows multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions.Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Klout.In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically.The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, most of which are also programming projects.
prereq: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient.
summary: Learn about functional programming, and how it can be effectively combined with object-oriented programming. Gain practice in writing clean functional code, using the Scala programming language.
title: Exploring Quantum Physics
objectives: Quantum
physics is the foundation for much of modern technology, provides the framework
for understanding light and matter from the subatomic to macroscopic domains,
and makes possible the most precise measurements ever made. More than just a theory, it offers a way of
looking at the world that grows richer with experience and practice. Our course will provide some of that practice and teach 
you "tricks of the trade" (not found in textbooks) that will enable you 
to solve quantum-mechanical problems yourself and understand the subject
 at a deeper level.The
basic principles of quantum physics are actually quite simple, but they lead to
astonishing outcomes. Two examples that
we will look at from various perspectives are the prediction of the laser by
Albert Einstein in 1917 and the prediction of antimatter by Paul Dirac in 1928. Both of these predictions came from very
simple arguments in quantum theory, and led to results that transformed science
and society. Another familiar
phenomenon, magnetism, had been known since antiquity, but only with the advent
of quantum physics was it understood how magnets worked, to a degree that made
possible the discovery in the 1980s of ultrastrong rare-earth magnets. However, lasers, antimatter and magnets are
areas of vibrant research, and they are all encountered in the new field of
ultracold atomic physics that will provide much of the material of Exploring
Quantum Physics.Richard
Feynman once said, I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum
mechanics. We say, thats no reason not
to try! What Feynman was referring to are some of the spooky phenomena like quantum entanglement, which are incomprehensible from the standpoint of classical physics. Even though they have been thoroughly tested by experiment, and are even being exploited for applications such as cryptography and logic processing, they still seem so counterintuitive that they give rise to extraordinary ideas such as the many-world theory. Quantum physics combines
a spectacular record of discovery and predictive success, with foundational
perplexities so severe that even Albert Einstein came to believe that it was
wrong. This is what makes it such an
exciting area of science!
prereq: The purpose of this course is to provide a 
graduate/advanced undergraduate level introduction to quantum 
mechanics. The emphasis throughout the course will be on applications 
of general techniques to specific quantum-mechanical problems and 
phenomena. Basic understanding of calculus and linear algebra is 
essential for completing this course, and knowledge of differential 
equations and Fourier transforms is valuable. Previous exposure to 
quantum mechanics would be helpful, but is not assumed. The course will 
be self-contained and an introduction will be provided.
summary: An introduction to quantum physics with emphasis on topics at the frontiers of research, and developing understanding through exercise.

title: Cryptography I
objectives: Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption and basic key-exchange.Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.The course will include written homeworks and programming labs. The course is self-contained, however it will be helpful to have a basic understanding of discrete probability theory.
prereq: 
summary: Learn about the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to apply this knowledge in real-world applications!
title: Computational Photography
objectives: The goal of this course is to introduce you to the basics of how computation
has impacted the entire workflow of photography (i.e., from how images
are captured, manipulated and collaborated on, and shared).The course begins with a conceptualization ofphotography as drawing
with light and the capturing of light to form images/videos. You
will learn about and understand how the optics and the sensor within a
camera are generalized, as well as learn about and understand how the lighting
and other aspects of the environment are also generalized through computation
to capture novel images.Pre- and post-processing techniques used to manipulate and improve images
will be discussed. Activities in this course are selected to give
you first hand experience with the power of the web and the Internet for
both analyzing and sharing images.This course is interdisciplinary and draws upon concepts and principles
from computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, mathematics
and optics.We look forward to your engagement and participation with both the course
and its discussion forums.Denis Lantsman is the TA for the class. Denis is a graduate of Harvey

On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge,dedication, and creativity.Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use. Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing.We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process.Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide.After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing boarda very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication.In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.
prereq: You should be able to perform the following tasks in a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), such as GarageBand, Pro Tools, Logic, Live, Reason, SONAR, or Digital Performer:
summary: Learn about the music production processincluding recording, editing, and mixingand the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer.

title: Women and the Civil Rights Movement
objectives: This
course examines the U.S. civil rights movement from the vantage point of women,
considering both womens involvement in the legal campaigns and political
protests and the impact of civil rights struggles on womens status and
identity. Taking a long civil rights
movement perspective, we begin in the late nineteenth century and consider
events, organizations, and personalities through the twentieth century.Throughout
we will consider issues which have preoccupied historians, social movement
theorists, and historians alike:
developing and sustaining political commitment, assessing the strengths
and weaknesses of various forms of political organization, maximizing influence
and securing long-range objectives. We
will also examine competing definitions of leadership; class, race, and gender
dynamics within the movement; and the cultural dynamics of political organizing
and social change.In the process, we
consider not only how the movement altered the status of African Americans in
the U.S. but the legacy of these struggles as they changed understandings of
citizenship and rights more broadly. Our concern throughout the course will be to
not only understand the historical narrative but also to see how historians
work to make sense of the past.
prereq: The
course includes significant reading of primary historical documents of the
civil rights movement and historians analyses.
summary: Learn about womens roles in the U.S. civil rights struggles of the 1890s to the 1990s.

title: AIDS
objectives: Did you grow up in a world without red ribbons, AZT, the
AIDS Memorial Quilt, or Project Red? If you did, chances are good that you came
of age before 1981 and are a member of the last generation of humans on this
planet to be able to say that you remember those carefree days when all you
had to worry about was getting pregnant, herpes, and a bad reputation ().On June 5, 1981 the CDC released adescribing theof what later became known as the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS.
On that day human history broke into two generations: Those who can remember a time beforethe AIDS pandemic and those who can't.No matter what generation you grew up in, what we all have
in common is a curiosity about AIDS. Where
did it come from? Why is it so widespread?Are we making progress towards
a vaccine? What is it like to be part of a vaccine trial? Has anyone ever been cured of HIV infection?Are some people just
naturally more or lesssusceptible to HIV than other people
are?All of this and more will be covered inOver the course of nine weeks we will discuss a wide range of
issues, innovations, and controversies regarding HIV/AIDS in the US and around
the world including everything from what circumcision and Truvada have in
common; how school children in Africa are changing the way AIDS education is
done; where you can go online to learn how many cases of AIDS there are in your
area; and how one mans insistence that AIDS doesn't existleft hundreds of thousands of peoplewithout access to life saving drugs.
prereq: This course does not assume any prior knowledge of, or

title: Natural Language Processing
objectives: Natural language processing (NLP) deals with the application of computational models to text or speech data. Application areas within NLP include automatic (machine) translation between languages; dialogue systems, which allow a human to interact with a machine using natural language; and information extraction, where the goal is to transform unstructured text into structured (database) representations that can be searched and browsed in flexible ways. NLP technologies are having a dramatic impact on the way people interact with computers, on the way people interact with each other through the use of language, and on the way people access the vast amount of linguistic data now in electronic form. From a scientific viewpoint, NLP involves fundamental questions of how to structure formal models (for example statistical models) of natural language phenomena, and of how to design algorithms that implement these models.In this course you will study mathematical and computational models of language, and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing. The course has a focus on machine learning methods, which are widely used in modern NLP systems: we will cover formalisms such as hidden Markov models, probabilistic context-free grammars, log-linear models, and statistical models for machine translation. The curriculum closely follows a course currently taught by Professor Collins at Columbia University, and previously taught at MIT.
prereq: A basic knowledge of probability (e.g., you should be familiar with random variables, independence assumptions, etc.), a basic knowledge of algorithms, and a basic knowledge of calculus (e.g., how to differentiate simple functions).
summary: Have you ever wondered how to build a system that automatically translates between languages? Or a system that can understand natural language instructions from a human?  This class will cover the fundamentals of mathematical and computational models of language, and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing.

title: Financial Engineering and Risk Management
objectives: Financial Engineering is a multidisciplinary field involving finance and economics, mathematics, statistics, engineering andcomputational methods.The emphasis of this course will beon the use ofsimple stochastic models and optimization for portfolio optimization, derivatives pricingand risk management.Our examples will draw from many asset classes including equities, fixed income, credit, mortgage-backed securitiesand structured products. We will also consider the role that some of these asset classes played during the financial crisis. If time permits, we will also discuss other applications including real options, energy andcommodities modeling, andalgorithmic trading among others.We hope that students who complete the course will have a good understanding of the "rocket science" behind financial engineering. But perhaps more importantly, we hope they will also understand the limitations of this theory in practice and why financial models should always be treated with a healthy degree ofskepticism.
prereq: Students should at some point have taken intermediate to advanced undergraduate coursesin: (i)probability and statistics(ii) linear algebra and (iii) calculus.With regards to programming, we have designed the course so that all required "programming" questions can be completed within Excel. However some questions may be easier to complete using Matlab, R, Python etc. but knowledge of these languages is not required. (Some of the more advanced optional questions may require something beyond Excel but we emphasize thatthese questions will be optional and not required to complete the course.)
summary: This course is an introduction to the theory and practice of financial engineering and risk management. We consider the pricing of derivatives, portfolio optimization and risk management and cast a critical eye on how these are used in practice.

objectives: This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.

title: The Modern and the Postmodern
objectives: traces the intertwining of the
idea of modernity with the idea of art or culture from the late 18th
century until the present. Beginning with the Enlightenment, Western cultures
have invested heavily in the notion that the world can be made more of a home
for human beings through the development of culture (and technology).
Throughout this period there has also developed a strong, sophisticated
counter-movement that sees the Enlightenment effort as a disaster  destructive
of both art and of the world.The
Western idea of modernity is linked to but not the same as the idea of
modernism. We will examine both in this class and then consider postmodernism
in relation both to the philosophical idea of modernity and to the aesthetic
considerations of modernism.
prereq: All are welcome!
summary: This course examines how the idea of "the modern" develops at the end of the 18th century and how being modern (or progressive, or hip) became one of the crucial criteria for understanding and evaluating cultural change during the last two hundred years. Are we still in modernity, or have we moved beyond the modern to the postmodern?

title: Networks: Friends, Money, and Bytes
objectives: You pick up your iPhone while waiting in line at a coffee shop. You google a not-so-famous actor, get linked to a Wikipedia entry listing his recent movies and popular YouTube clips of several of them. You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one, download that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you're on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade, but you don't know if it's the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere. In any case, it costs you $10 per Gigabyte, and you decide to stop watching the movie, and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You're happy with the call quality, but get a little irritated when you see there're no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don't. Take a look at the list of 20 questions below. Each question is selected not just for its relevance to our daily lives, but also for the core concepts in the field of networking illustrated by its answers. This course is about formulating and answering these 20 questions.This course will launch the Grand Challenge Homework (GCH) program. Throughout the course, there will be about 10 open-ended, project-like challenges (in social and technological network engineering) provided to all the enrolled students. Associated with GCH is a Industry and Investor Partners (IIP) program. About 10 leading US companies and venture capitalists in the networking industry have agreed to screen the finalists selected by the teaching staff, and then explore opportunities with the selected students to turn their ideas and prototypes into new products and companies. You pour your creativity and energy in this course, we will help create career-changing opportunities for you.The IIP companies associated with this course range from the world-renowned Bell Labs to a startup founded by the father of DSL, and from Silicon Valley VC's like USVP to university-spinoff specialist firms like Osage Partners.
prereq: Basic linear algebra and multivariable calculus. However, if you don't have these prerequisites, you can still sign up now, and in September the instructor will see if part of the course material can be presented without requiring this mathematical background.
summary: A course driven by 20 practical questions about wireless, web, and the Internet, about how products from companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Ericsson, HP, Skype and AT&T work.

url: https://www.coursera.org/course/bioelectricity
title: Bioelectricity: A Quantitative Approach
objectives: In this class you will learn how to think about electrically active
tissue in terms of individual mechanisms, and you will learn to analyze the
mechanisms quantitatively as well as describe them qualitatively. The
course uses many of the same examples used by Hodgkin and Huxley, who won the
Nobel Prize for their experimental unraveling of the mechanisms of the nerve
axon of the giant squid, and their creation of a mathematical model of
membranes and propagation to understand its function. That work has been
the foundational element of most subsequent understandings of electrically
active tissue, whether in nerves, the brain or in muscle, including the heart.In this course, topics include:The course will at each step present equations and other quantitative reasoning so that you will be able to go beyond describing what happens qualitatively and be able to link together the phenomena in the mosaic in a quantitative fashion, which is essential to judging whether specific changes in inputs are important to the outcome. Through the use of quantitative analysis, you will learn that all the elements of the system are tied together and be able to link together and analyze the effects of one part on another.
prereq: Insofar as
Bioelectricity, this course begins at the beginning, so all the main ideas can
be understood without prerequisite courses. As electricity is invisible,
no one sees it, so the most important prerequisite is ones willingness to
bring imagination, reflection and patience to the topics, so as to allow the
ideas to grow and knit together in ones own mind.Some of the
presentation uses equations and other mathematics that come from calculus and
differential equations and other parts reason from the physics of electricity
and the analysis of circuits, so background knowledge about these subjects is
helpful. For example, one needs to recognize that dV/dt is the rate of change
of voltage V with time t, so as to understand that C dV/dt is the current
through a capacitor C. As another example, if V=1/r, what is dV/dr?A course
like this one usually is given to advanced undergraduates or early graduate
students in science and engineering, as these students have taken calculus and
physics, and differential equations and circuits, and thus are comfortable when
notation or simple operations from these fields are used.
summary: Nerves, the heart, and the brain are electrical. How do these things work? This course presents fundamental principles, described quantitatively.

objectives: Financial Engineering is a multidisciplinary field involving finance and economics, mathematics, statistics, engineering andcomputational methods.The emphasis of this course will beon the use ofsimple stochastic models and optimization for portfolio optimization, derivatives pricingand risk management.Our examples will draw from many asset classes including equities, fixed income, credit, mortgage-backed securitiesand structured products. We will also consider the role that some of these asset classes played during the financial crisis. If time permits, we will also discuss other applications including real options, energy andcommodities modeling, andalgorithmic trading among others.We hope that students who complete the course will have a good understanding of the "rocket science" behind financial engineering. But perhaps more importantly, we hope they will also understand the limitations of this theory in practice and why financial models should always be treated with a healthy degree ofskepticism.
prereq: Students should at some point have taken intermediate to advanced undergraduate coursesin: (i)probability and statistics(ii) linear algebra and (iii) calculus.With regards to programming, we have designed the course so that all required "programming" questions can be completed within Excel. However some questions may be easier to complete using Matlab, R, Python etc. but knowledge of these languages is not required. (Some of the more advanced optional questions may require something beyond Excel but we emphasize thatthese questions will be optional and not required to complete the course.)
summary: This course is an introduction to the theory and practice of financial engineering and risk management. We consider the pricing of derivatives, portfolio optimization and risk management and cast a critical eye on how these are used in practice.
title: Computational Investing, Part I
objectives: Why do the prices of some companies stocks seem to move up and down together while others move separately? What does portfolio diversification really mean and how important is it? What should the price of a stock be? How can we discover and exploit the relationships between equity prices automatically? Well examine these questions, and others, from a computational point of view. You will learn many of the principles and algorithms hedge funds and investment professionals use to maximize return and reduce risk in equity portfolios.
prereq: The course is intended for people with software programming experience and introductory levelknowledge of investment practice.The primary prerequisite is an excitement about the stock market.If you alreadyuse advanced software tools such as Mean Variance Optimizers in your regular investing practice, you will probably find that you are "overqualified" for this course.Check out the two links below to see if the course is a good match.
summary: Find out how modern electronic markets work, why stock prices change in the ways they do, and how computation can help our understanding of them. Build algorithms and visualizations to inform investing practice.
title: Linear and Discrete Optimization
objectives: This
 course serves as an introduction to linear and discrete 
optimization from the viewpoint of a mathematician or computer 
scientist. Besides learning how linear and discrete optimization can be applied, we focus on 
understanding methods that solve linear programs and discrete optimization problems in a mathematically 
rigorous way.We will answer questions like:The
 course starts by discussing what a linear program is and how linear programming can be 
applied. Then, we will treat the simplex method and the theory of 
duality. We will then discuss some combinatorial optimization problems like maximum weight bipartite matching and maximum flows.The
 course constitutes about half of the material on linear and discrete optimization 
that is taught for mathematics and computer science undergraduates at 
EPFL and will feature video lectures, quizzes, programming assignments, 
and a final exam.
prereq: The
 most important prerequisite is familiarity with linear algebra. It will
 be useful to have some programming proficiency in a higher level 
programming language such as Java or Python.
summary: The course is an introduction to linear and discrete optimization - an important part of computational mathematics with a wide range of applications in many areas of everyday life.
title: Digital Signal Processing
objectives: The goal of the course is to develop a complete working set of digital signal processing notions from the ground up. DSP is arguably at the heart of the digital revolution that, in the space of just a few decades, has enabled unprecedented levels of interpersonal communication and of information availability.In the class, starting from the basic definitions of a discrete-time signal, we will work our way through Fourier analysis, filter design, sampling, interpolation and quantization to build a DSP toolset complete enough to analyze a practical communication system in detail. Hands-on examples and demonstration will be routinely used to close the gap between theory and practice.
prereq: Fundamentals of linear algebra and calculus are a must. Familiarity with probability theory and system theory are highly recommended. Familiarity with Matlab (or equivalent) and/or scientific programming are a plus.
summary: Learn the fundamentals of digital signal processing theory and discover the myriad ways DSP makes everyday life more productive and fun.
title: Analyse Numrique pour Ingnieurs
objectives: L'analyse numrique fait partie de ce que l'on appelle aujourd'hui "Scientific Computing" ou encore "Computational Sciences". Il s'agit de faire des simulations numriques de phnomnes complexes, par exemple l'coulement autour d'un avion, le retrait pass ou futur d'un glacier, ou encore des effets spciaux pour l'industrie du cinma.Le cheminement permettant d'obtenir une simulation numrique est le suivant.
prereq: 
summary: Ce cours contient les 7 premiers chapitres d'un cours donn aux tudiants bachelor de l'EPFL. Il est bas sur le livre "Introduction  l'analyse numrique", J. Rappaz M. Picasso, Ed. PPUR.

title: Compilers
objectives: This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.
prereq: 
summary: This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers. You will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines!
title: Analytic Combinatorics, Part I
objectives: Analytic Combinatorics aims to enable precise quantitative predictions of the properties of large combinatorial structures. The theory has emerged over recent decades as essential both for the scientific analysis of algorithms in computer science and for the study of scientific models in many other disciplines, including probability theory, statistical physics, computational biology and information theory. Part I of this course covers recurrence relations, generating functions, asymptotics, and fundamental structures such as trees, permutations, strings, tries, words, and mappings, in the context of applications to the analysis of algorithms.
prereq: Math through calculus, CS through algorithms recommended.
summary: This course teaches a calculus that enables precise quantitative predictions of large combinatorial structures. Part I covers generating functions and real asymptotics and then introduces the symbolic method in the context of applications in the analysis of algorithms and basic structures such as permutations, trees, strings, words, and mappings.
title: The Modern and the Postmodern
objectives: traces the intertwining of the
idea of modernity with the idea of art or culture from the late 18th
century until the present. Beginning with the Enlightenment, Western cultures
have invested heavily in the notion that the world can be made more of a home
for human beings through the development of culture (and technology).
Throughout this period there has also developed a strong, sophisticated
counter-movement that sees the Enlightenment effort as a disaster  destructive
of both art and of the world.The
Western idea of modernity is linked to but not the same as the idea of
modernism. We will examine both in this class and then consider postmodernism
in relation both to the philosophical idea of modernity and to the aesthetic
considerations of modernism.
prereq: All are welcome!
summary: This course examines how the idea of "the modern" develops at the end of the 18th century and how being modern (or progressive, or hip) became one of the crucial criteria for understanding and evaluating cultural change during the last two hundred years. Are we still in modernity, or have we moved beyond the modern to the postmodern?
title: Networks: Friends, Money, and Bytes
objectives: You pick up your iPhone while waiting in line at a coffee shop. You google a not-so-famous actor, get linked to a Wikipedia entry listing his recent movies and popular YouTube clips of several of them. You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one, download that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you're on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade, but you don't know if it's the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere. In any case, it costs you $10 per Gigabyte, and you decide to stop watching the movie, and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You're happy with the call quality, but get a little irritated when you see there're no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don't. Take a look at the list of 20 questions below. Each question is selected not just for its relevance to our daily lives, but also for the core concepts in the field of networking illustrated by its answers. This course is about formulating and answering these 20 questions.This course will launch the Grand Challenge Homework (GCH) program. Throughout the course, there will be about 10 open-ended, project-like challenges (in social and technological network engineering) provided to all the enrolled students. Associated with GCH is a Industry and Investor Partners (IIP) program. About 10 leading US companies and venture capitalists in the networking industry have agreed to screen the finalists selected by the teaching staff, and then explore opportunities with the selected students to turn their ideas and prototypes into new products and companies. You pour your creativity and energy in this course, we will help create career-changing opportunities for you.The IIP companies associated with this course range from the world-renowned Bell Labs to a startup founded by the father of DSL, and from Silicon Valley VC's like USVP to university-spinoff specialist firms like Osage Partners.
prereq: Basic linear algebra and multivariable calculus. However, if you don't have these prerequisites, you can still sign up now, and in September the instructor will see if part of the course material can be presented without requiring this mathematical background.
summary: A course driven by 20 practical questions about wireless, web, and the Internet, about how products from companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Ericsson, HP, Skype and AT&T work.
title: Bioelectricity: A Quantitative Approach
objectives: In this class you will learn how to think about electrically active
tissue in terms of individual mechanisms, and you will learn to analyze the
mechanisms quantitatively as well as describe them qualitatively. The
course uses many of the same examples used by Hodgkin and Huxley, who won the
Nobel Prize for their experimental unraveling of the mechanisms of the nerve
axon of the giant squid, and their creation of a mathematical model of
membranes and propagation to understand its function. That work has been
the foundational element of most subsequent understandings of electrically
active tissue, whether in nerves, the brain or in muscle, including the heart.In this course, topics include:The course will at each step present equations and other quantitative reasoning so that you will be able to go beyond describing what happens qualitatively and be able to link together the phenomena in the mosaic in a quantitative fashion, which is essential to judging whether specific changes in inputs are important to the outcome. Through the use of quantitative analysis, you will learn that all the elements of the system are tied together and be able to link together and analyze the effects of one part on another.
prereq: Insofar as
Bioelectricity, this course begins at the beginning, so all the main ideas can
be understood without prerequisite courses. As electricity is invisible,
no one sees it, so the most important prerequisite is ones willingness to
bring imagination, reflection and patience to the topics, so as to allow the
ideas to grow and knit together in ones own mind.Some of the
presentation uses equations and other mathematics that come from calculus and
differential equations and other parts reason from the physics of electricity
and the analysis of circuits, so background knowledge about these subjects is
helpful. For example, one needs to recognize that dV/dt is the rate of change
of voltage V with time t, so as to understand that C dV/dt is the current
through a capacitor C. As another example, if V=1/r, what is dV/dr?A course
like this one usually is given to advanced undergraduates or early graduate
students in science and engineering, as these students have taken calculus and
physics, and differential equations and circuits, and thus are comfortable when
notation or simple operations from these fields are used.
summary: Nerves, the heart, and the brain are electrical. How do these things work? This course presents fundamental principles, described quantitatively.

title: Control of Mobile Robots
objectives: This course investigates how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, and predictable ways. The basic tool for achieving this is "control theory", which deals with the question of how dynamical systems, i.e., systems whose behaviors change over time, can be effectively influenced. In the course, these two domains - controls and robotics - will be interleaved and we will go from the basics of control theory, via robotic examples of increasing complexity - all the way to the research frontier. The course will focus on mobile robots as the target application and problems that will be covered include (1) how to make (teams of) wheeled ground robots avoid collisions while reaching target locations, (2) how to make aerial, quadrotor robots follow paths in the presence of severe disturbances, and (3) how to locomotive bipedal, humanoid robots.
prereq: The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 8 and 12 minutes in length. These contain 1-2 integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone homework and a final exam.
summary: Learn about how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, predictable, and collaborative ways using modern control theory.

url: https://www.coursera.org/course/modernworld
title: The Modern World: Global History since 1760
objectives: This is a survey course in modern world history for
students, beginning or advanced, who wish to better understand how the world
got to be the way it is today. In order to understand modern history, a global
perspective is essential. This is true whether you are interested in economics,
warfare, philosophy, politics, or even pop culture. This course can therefore
be essential for students in many fields, a base equipping them with tools for
lifelong learning.In its current form, the course on Coursera is not offered
for college credit. But it is a vital part of the for credit course on this
topic being offered at the University of Virginia in the spring semester of
2013. Both the Coursera and the UVA students will use the same online material as
a common foundation for their different learning experiences. This is the material to survey 'what
happened' and the big questions about how to explain so many changes  some of
those questions that start with:
"Why?" (The students in
the UVA course then supplement this online material with a lot of additional
reading, research projects about the histories of particular communities around
the world, in-person tutorials and discussions both with me and with their
graduate teaching assistants, and examinations.)It is tempting to think that if we can just understand the
big patterns, we don't have to get too caught up in the details. In this
course, though, we care about chronology. We care about individuals. Without some
careful attention to sequences of cause and effect, without tracing how big
changes come from the choices made by particular people, history can turn into
just a series of descriptions, a somewhat tiresome recitation of one thing
after another. Not this course. So a big part of what we will do is not only
offer a set of remarkable stories, but also offer you training in how to
analyze a situation andhow to think about problems of explaining change.
prereq: No background is required. All that is needed is an interest in historical exploration.
summary: This is a survey of modern history from a global perspective. It begins with the revolutions of the late 1700s, tracks the transformation of the world during the 1800s, and analyzes the cataclysms of last century, concluding with the new phase of world history we are experiencing today.

title: Image and video processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a stop at the hospital
objectives: What is image and video processing? Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression, the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video. Once we have covered the fundamentals, which both provide the basis for modern image and video processing and serve many important applications until today, we will move into recent progress in the area, covering image inpainting (how to remove objects from images and video), image processing via sparse modeling and compressed sensing, geometric partial differential equations for image analysis, image processing for HIV and virus research, and image processing for neurosurgery and other medical applications.
prereq: Image and video analysis can be approached from numerous areas of mathematics, from linear algebra to geometry, optimization, and differential equations. We plan to make all the lectures as self-contained as possible, but basic background in linear algebra and digital signal processing will be helpful.
summary: In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.

title: Principles of Economics for Scientists
objectives: The impact of economic forces in our lives is sizable and pervasive. For this reason, it is impossible to understand the social and economic forces shaping our lives without a good understanding of basic economic principles. This course provides a quantitative and model-based introduction to such principles, and teaches how to apply them to make sense of a wide range of real world problems. Examples of applications include predicting the impact of technological changes in market prices, calculating the optimal gasoline tax, and measuring the value of new products.This is a real Caltech class. It will be taught concurrently to Caltech and on-line students. This has two implications. On the costs side: the class is challenging, highly quantitative, and will demand significant effort. On the benefit side: successful completion of the class will provide you with an in-depth understanding of basic economics, and will permanently change the way you see the world.
prereq: A strong quantitative background, and basic (univariate) calculus (equivalent of Caltechs Math 1a).
summary: Quantitative and model-based introduction to basic ideas in economics, and applications to a wide range of real world problems.

title: Game Theory
objectives: Popularized by movies such as "A Beautiful Mind", game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what we call 'games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model eBay, Google keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more. We'll include a variety of examples including classic games and real-world applications.
prereq: You must be comfortable with mathematical thinking and rigorous 
arguments. Relatively little specific math is required; the course 
involves lightweight probability theory (for example, you should know 
what a conditional probability is) and very lightweight calculus (for 
instance, taking a derivative).
summary: The course covers the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), repeated and stochastic games, coalitional games, and Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions).

title: Neural Networks for Machine Learning
objectives: Neural networks use learning algorithms that are inspired by our understanding of how the brain learns, but they are evaluated by how well they work for practical applications such as speech recognition, object recognition, image retrieval and the ability to recommend products that a user will like. As computers become more powerful, Neural Networks are gradually taking over from simpler Machine Learning methods. They are already at the heart of a new generation of speech recognition devices and they are beginning to outperform earlier systems for recognizing objects in images. The course will explain the new learning procedures that are responsible for these advances, including effective new proceduresr for learning multiple layers of non-linear features, and give you the skills and understanding required to apply these procedures in many other domains.gives examples of the kind of material that will be in the course, but the course will present this material at a much gentler rate and with more examples.
prereq: The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 5 and 15 minutes in length. These contain 1-3 integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone homework that is not part of video lectures, optional programming assignments, and a (not optional) final test.
summary: Learn about artificial neural networks and how they're being used for machine learning, as applied to speech and object recognition, image segmentation, modeling language and human motion, etc. We'll emphasize both the basic algorithms and the practical tricks needed to get them to work well.

title: Writing in the Sciences
objectives: This course trains scientists to become more effective, efficient, and confident writers. This is a hands-on course that emphasizes interactive examples and practice. In the first four weeks, we will review principles of effective writing, examples of good and bad writing, and tips for making the writing process easier. In the second four weeks, we will examine issues specific to scientific writing, including: authorship, peer review, the format of an original manuscript, and communicating science for lay audiences. Students will complete editing exercises, write two short papers, and edit each others work.The primary audience is undergraduate science majors, graduate students in scientific disciplines, and professional scientists. Students from non-science disciplines can also benefit from the training provided in the first four weeks (on general principles of effective writing).
prereq: The course has no prerequisites other than fluency in English.
summary: This course teaches scientists to become more effective writers, using practical examples and exercises. Topics include: principles of good writing, tricks for writing faster and with less anxiety, the format of a scientific manuscript, and issues in publication and peer review.

title: Organizational Analysis
objectives: It is hard to imagine living in modern society without participating in or interacting with organizations. The ubiquity and variability of organizations means there is ample room for complexity and confusion in the organizational challenges we regularly face. Through this course, students will consider cases describing various organizational struggles: school systems and politicians attempting to implement education reforms; government administrators dealing with an international crisis; technology firms trying to create a company ethos that sustains worker commitment; and even two universities trying to gain international standing by performing a merger.Each case is full of details and complexity. So how do we make sense of organizations and the challenges they face, let alone develop means of managing them in desired directions? While every detail can matter, some matter more than others. This is why we rely on organizational theories -- to focus our attention and draw out relevant features in a sensible way.Through this course you will come to see that there is nothing more practical than a good theory. Every week, youll learn a different organizational theory, and it will become a lens through which you can interpret concrete organizational situations. Armed with a toolset of theories, you will then be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it  and use the theories to predict which actions will best redirect the organization in a desired direction.
prereq: None; all are welcome.
summary: In this introductory course, you will learn multiple theories of organizational behavior and apply them to actual cases of organizational change.

This course is intended for people who have never seen a computer program. It will give you a better understanding of how computer applications work and teach you how to write your own applications. More importantly, youll start to learn computational thinking, which is a fundamental approach to solving real-world problems. Computer programming languages share common fundamental concepts, and this course will introduce you to those concepts using the Python programming language. By the end of this course, you will be able to write your own programs to process data from the web and create interactive text-based games.
prereq: The class consists of 1 to 2 hours of lecture each week, which are made up of videos that are generally shorter than 10 minutes each. Each video contains integrated quiz questions. There are also weekly standalone exercises that are not part of the video lectures and a (non-optional) final exam.
summary: Behind every mouse click and touch-screen tap, there is a computer program that makes things happen. This course introduces the fundamental building blocks of programming and teaches you how to write fun and useful programs using the Python language.

title: Energy 101
objectives: Energy 101 focuses on the big energy picture giving perspective and context to the details one reads in the daily onslaught of energy news in the headlines. As the number 101 indicates, there are no pre-requisites and no particular training or background needed. The course will review the driving forces of energy used in transportation, building heating and cooling, electrical loads and manufacturing. The current facts and trends of the resulting demands placed on coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, biomass, solar and wind used to meet these energy demands are then covered. The technologies and characteristics of different energy processes and infrastructure used to convert the renewable, fossil, and nuclear energy into the desired form necessary to accomplish a given task are then described. Economics is always a part of the discussion. The natural laws of thermodynamics limiting these processes are described, as well as future technologies and their potential.
prereq: The class will consist of lecture videos which are between 5  12 minutes in length. There will be standalone quizzes that are not part of the video lectures.
summary: As a society and individually, we use energy every moment of our lives to improve our quality of life. Energy 101 will develop the big picture and connect the details of our energy use, technology, infrastructure, impact, and future.
title: Control of Mobile Robots
objectives: This course investigates how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, and predictable ways. The basic tool for achieving this is "control theory", which deals with the question of how dynamical systems, i.e., systems whose behaviors change over time, can be effectively influenced. In the course, these two domains - controls and robotics - will be interleaved and we will go from the basics of control theory, via robotic examples of increasing complexity - all the way to the research frontier. The course will focus on mobile robots as the target application and problems that will be covered include (1) how to make (teams of) wheeled ground robots avoid collisions while reaching target locations, (2) how to make aerial, quadrotor robots follow paths in the presence of severe disturbances, and (3) how to locomotive bipedal, humanoid robots.
prereq: The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 8 and 12 minutes in length. These contain 1-2 integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone homework and a final exam.
summary: Learn about how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, predictable, and collaborative ways using modern control theory.
title: Fundamentals of Human Nutrition
objectives: 
prereq: 
summary: This introductory course provides an overview of the principles of nutritional science. Subject matter includes description and functions of nutrients, digestion and absorption, effects of nutrient deficiencies and toxicities, requirements, food sources, nutrient interactions, dietary guidelines, and the role of nutrition in health and disease.
title: Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering
objectives: The course focuses on the creation, manipulation, transmission, and reception of information by electronic means. The topics covered include elementary signal theory; time- and frequency-domain analysis of signals; conversion of analog signals to a digital form; and how information can be represented with signals. Signal processing, both analog and digital, allow information to be extracted and manipulated. The course then turns to information theory, which demonstrates the technological advantages of digital transmission.The course text was written by the instructor for this course and is entirely online. You can print your own hard copy or view the material entirely online.
prereq: Knowledge of Calculus
summary: This course probes fundamental ideas in electrical engineering, seeking to understand how electrical signals convey information, how bits can represent smooth signals like music and how modern communication systems work.
title: The Modern World: Global History since 1760
objectives: This is a survey course in modern world history for
students, beginning or advanced, who wish to better understand how the world
got to be the way it is today. In order to understand modern history, a global
perspective is essential. This is true whether you are interested in economics,
warfare, philosophy, politics, or even pop culture. This course can therefore
be essential for students in many fields, a base equipping them with tools for
lifelong learning.In its current form, the course on Coursera is not offered
for college credit. But it is a vital part of the for credit course on this
topic being offered at the University of Virginia in the spring semester of
2013. Both the Coursera and the UVA students will use the same online material as
a common foundation for their different learning experiences. This is the material to survey 'what
happened' and the big questions about how to explain so many changes  some of
those questions that start with:
"Why?" (The students in
the UVA course then supplement this online material with a lot of additional
reading, research projects about the histories of particular communities around
the world, in-person tutorials and discussions both with me and with their
graduate teaching assistants, and examinations.)It is tempting to think that if we can just understand the
big patterns, we don't have to get too caught up in the details. In this
course, though, we care about chronology. We care about individuals. Without some
careful attention to sequences of cause and effect, without tracing how big
changes come from the choices made by particular people, history can turn into
just a series of descriptions, a somewhat tiresome recitation of one thing
after another. Not this course. So a big part of what we will do is not only
offer a set of remarkable stories, but also offer you training in how to
analyze a situation andhow to think about problems of explaining change.
prereq: No background is required. All that is needed is an interest in historical exploration.
summary: This is a survey of modern history from a global perspective. It begins with the revolutions of the late 1700s, tracks the transformation of the world during the 1800s, and analyzes the cataclysms of last century, concluding with the new phase of world history we are experiencing today.
title: Image and video processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a stop at the hospital
objectives: What is image and video processing? Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression, the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video. Once we have covered the fundamentals, which both provide the basis for modern image and video processing and serve many important applications until today, we will move into recent progress in the area, covering image inpainting (how to remove objects from images and video), image processing via sparse modeling and compressed sensing, geometric partial differential equations for image analysis, image processing for HIV and virus research, and image processing for neurosurgery and other medical applications.
prereq: Image and video analysis can be approached from numerous areas of mathematics, from linear algebra to geometry, optimization, and differential equations. We plan to make all the lectures as self-contained as possible, but basic background in linear algebra and digital signal processing will be helpful.
summary: In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.
title: Principles of Economics for Scientists
objectives: The impact of economic forces in our lives is sizable and pervasive. For this reason, it is impossible to understand the social and economic forces shaping our lives without a good understanding of basic economic principles. This course provides a quantitative and model-based introduction to such principles, and teaches how to apply them to make sense of a wide range of real world problems. Examples of applications include predicting the impact of technological changes in market prices, calculating the optimal gasoline tax, and measuring the value of new products.This is a real Caltech class. It will be taught concurrently to Caltech and on-line students. This has two implications. On the costs side: the class is challenging, highly quantitative, and will demand significant effort. On the benefit side: successful completion of the class will provide you with an in-depth understanding of basic economics, and will permanently change the way you see the world.
prereq: A strong quantitative background, and basic (univariate) calculus (equivalent of Caltechs Math 1a).
summary: Quantitative and model-based introduction to basic ideas in economics, and applications to a wide range of real world problems.
title: Game Theory
objectives: Popularized by movies such as "A Beautiful Mind", game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what we call 'games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model eBay, Google keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more. We'll include a variety of examples including classic games and real-world applications.
prereq: You must be comfortable with mathematical thinking and rigorous 
arguments. Relatively little specific math is required; the course 
involves lightweight probability theory (for example, you should know 
what a conditional probability is) and very lightweight calculus (for 
instance, taking a derivative).
summary: The course covers the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), repeated and stochastic games, coalitional games, and Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions).
title: Neural Networks for Machine Learning
objectives: Neural networks use learning algorithms that are inspired by our understanding of how the brain learns, but they are evaluated by how well they work for practical applications such as speech recognition, object recognition, image retrieval and the ability to recommend products that a user will like. As computers become more powerful, Neural Networks are gradually taking over from simpler Machine Learning methods. They are already at the heart of a new generation of speech recognition devices and they are beginning to outperform earlier systems for recognizing objects in images. The course will explain the new learning procedures that are responsible for these advances, including effective new proceduresr for learning multiple layers of non-linear features, and give you the skills and understanding required to apply these procedures in many other domains.gives examples of the kind of material that will be in the course, but the course will present this material at a much gentler rate and with more examples.
prereq: The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 5 and 15 minutes in length. These contain 1-3 integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone homework that is not part of video lectures, optional programming assignments, and a (not optional) final test.
summary: Learn about artificial neural networks and how they're being used for machine learning, as applied to speech and object recognition, image segmentation, modeling language and human motion, etc. We'll emphasize both the basic algorithms and the practical tricks needed to get them to work well.
title: Writing in the Sciences
objectives: This course trains scientists to become more effective, efficient, and confident writers. This is a hands-on course that emphasizes interactive examples and practice. In the first four weeks, we will review principles of effective writing, examples of good and bad writing, and tips for making the writing process easier. In the second four weeks, we will examine issues specific to scientific writing, including: authorship, peer review, the format of an original manuscript, and communicating science for lay audiences. Students will complete editing exercises, write two short papers, and edit each others work.The primary audience is undergraduate science majors, graduate students in scientific disciplines, and professional scientists. Students from non-science disciplines can also benefit from the training provided in the first four weeks (on general principles of effective writing).
prereq: The course has no prerequisites other than fluency in English.
summary: This course teaches scientists to become more effective writers, using practical examples and exercises. Topics include: principles of good writing, tricks for writing faster and with less anxiety, the format of a scientific manuscript, and issues in publication and peer review.
title: Organizational Analysis
objectives: It is hard to imagine living in modern society without participating in or interacting with organizations. The ubiquity and variability of organizations means there is ample room for complexity and confusion in the organizational challenges we regularly face. Through this course, students will consider cases describing various organizational struggles: school systems and politicians attempting to implement education reforms; government administrators dealing with an international crisis; technology firms trying to create a company ethos that sustains worker commitment; and even two universities trying to gain international standing by performing a merger.Each case is full of details and complexity. So how do we make sense of organizations and the challenges they face, let alone develop means of managing them in desired directions? While every detail can matter, some matter more than others. This is why we rely on organizational theories -- to focus our attention and draw out relevant features in a sensible way.Through this course you will come to see that there is nothing more practical than a good theory. Every week, youll learn a different organizational theory, and it will become a lens through which you can interpret concrete organizational situations. Armed with a toolset of theories, you will then be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it  and use the theories to predict which actions will best redirect the organization in a desired direction.
prereq: None; all are welcome.
summary: In this introductory course, you will learn multiple theories of organizational behavior and apply them to actual cases of organizational change.
title: Learn to Program: The Fundamentals
objectives: A computer program is a set of instructions for a computer to follow, just as a recipe is a set of instructions for a chef. Laptops, kitchen appliances, MP3 players, and many other electronic devices all run computer programs. Programs have been written to manipulate sound and video, write poetry, run banking systems, predict the weather, and analyze athletic performance. This course is intended for people who have never seen a computer program. It will give you a better understanding of how computer applications work and teach you how to write your own applications. More importantly, youll start to learn computational thinking, which is a fundamental approach to solving real-world problems. Computer programming languages share common fundamental concepts, and this course will introduce you to those concepts using the Python programming language. By the end of this course, you will be able to write your own programs to process data from the web and create interactive text-based games.
prereq: The class consists of 1 to 2 hours of lecture each week, which are made up of videos that are generally shorter than 10 minutes each. Each video contains integrated quiz questions. There are also weekly standalone exercises that are not part of the video lectures and a (non-optional) final exam.
summary: Behind every mouse click and touch-screen tap, there is a computer program that makes things happen. This course introduces the fundamental building blocks of programming and teaches you how to write fun and useful programs using the Python language.

title: Conditions of War and Peace
objectives: Discourse on war and peace has gone through a remarkable transition during
    the two decades after the end of the Cold War. We do not have to worry
    of major nuclear wars, and then, no longer can we anticipate stability
    based on nuclear deterrence. We have no immediate threat emanating from
    a belligerent adversary equipped with a major arsenal, but we observe a
    number of small to medium military powers that are more belligerent than
    the days of the Soviet Union. We have more democracies in the world, and
    yet are far from the democratic peace that has been imagined by the students
    of international relations.This course aims to nail down some of the basic issues that had been argued
    in the current research on peace and security. The questions are all deceptively
    simple enough, but then the answers will all be ambiguous at best. It is
    my hope that you will be able to provide better answers than those given
    in the course by developing your own analytical capacity.

title: Sren Kierkegaard - Subjectivity, Irony and the Crisis of Modernity
objectives: It is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are typically
    modern philosophical problems that emerge with the breakdown of traditional
    values, customs and ways of life. The result is the absence of meaning,
    the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread
    in modernity.The Danish thinker Sren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one of the most penetrating
    analyses of this complex phenomenon. But somewhat surprisingly he seeks
    insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in an ancient one,
    the Greek philosopher Socrates.
prereq: 
summary: In this course we will explore how Kierkegaard deals with the problems associated with relativism, the lack of meaning and the undermining of religious faith that are typical of modern life. His penetrating analyses are still highly relevant today and have been seen as insightful for the leading figures of Existentialism, Post-Structuralism and Post-Modernism.

MDCourse director: Dr Samantha Battams, PhDCourse coordinators: Dr Slim Slama, MD and Dr Didier WernliCourse assistant: Dr Rafael Ruiz De Castaneda, PhDIn our globalizing world, Infectious diseases travel quickly and widely
across countries, so do the large determinants of chronic diseases resulting
in a growing burden in developed but also developing countries. Issues
in traditionally non health sector such as Climate change or trade governance
can have dramatic and worldwide effects on health and health systems.These short examples illustrate what Global health is about: issues
that not only cross national boundaries but also disciplinary territories.
In our interdependent world, more and more health issues cannot be addressed
by a country nor by a sector alone and require collaboration, coordination
and integration.
prereq: No background is required; all are welcome!
summary: This course proposes an overview of current global health challenges drawing on the insights of several academic disciplines including medicine, public health, law, economics, social sciences and humanities. This interdisciplinary approach will guide the student into seven critical topics in global health.

title: Live!:  A History of Art for Artists, Animators and Gamers
objectives: This course approaches the questions of art and history
from the perspective of contemporary makers of art (sculpture, painting,
photography, performance, installation and more), animators (whether
character/story-based or experimental) and gamers, asking how artists actively
make a history for their own practices by thinking about the creative process
as a conversation with a wide range of art from the past. Why are ground-breaking artists so often
historically-minded (and yet tend to break all the rules of conventional
history-telling)? How do animators
themselves write the largely unwritten history of their art through
quotation, transposition and mash-ups?
Why should contemporary gamers look at classical painting anyway?This course will combine short video lectures/interviews and
interactive quizzes with independent, peer-reviewedsketchbook and field work (suggested visits to
local museums, film viewings, etc.). It is
intended to give the student a background in a wide range of visual practices and
a greater familiarity with techniques of historical analysis. It will help to build skills in visual
analysis, and will also provide insight into the creative culture of CalArts,
where a certain portion of these art histories have been made in the first
place.
prereq: This class will consist of video lectures (about 10 minutes in length) combined with videointerviews with guest artists and virtual "field trips" to artist studios and workplaces, museums and galleries. Lectures will focus on key topics, including "story," "character," "language," "time," "dimensionality," "novelty," etc., exposing students to a wide range of art from around the world.Students will be required to keep a sketchbook, complete "looking, thinking and making" assignments for peer assessment. A final exam will test comprehension of key concepts.
summary: Explore art history from the artist's perspective.  Learn how contemporary artists, animators and gamers work from the art of the past as part of their creative process, while building your own skills in visual analysis and creative and critical thinking.

title: Introduction to Programming for Musicians and Digital Artists
objectives: The course, lecture, and examples build on each other to teach the fundamentals
    of programming in general (logic, loops, functions, objects, classes) and
    also deals with advanced topics including multi-threading, events and signals.
    Throughout the course, students create meaningful and rewarding expressive
    digital instruments that make sound and music in direct response to program
    logic. The ChucK language provides precise high-level control over
    time, audio computation, and user interface elements (track pad, joysticks,
    etc.). ChucK is used (unknowingly in most cases, via SMule Apps)
    by millions of users throughout the world, and is the backbone of dozens
    of academic programs and laptop orchestras. Learning to program using
    ChucK, through the musical examples provided in this course, will prepare
    students to program in C++, Java, and other languages. There will be special
    guest lectures from creators of the ChucK language, Dr.Ge Wang (Stanford
    University) and Dr. Perry R.Cook (Princeton University).
prereq: Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement
    of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.
summary: This course provides a complete introduction to programming for digital musicians and
artists, in the real-time multimedia language ChucK. Rich with practical examples and
pointers to additional web resources, it can be understood by novices wishing to learn to
program interactive arts systems.

environmental inspired site projects ranging from large-scale to small
(guerrilla) style productions. We willdelineate definitions of
site-specificity, andlook across the history of the field, focusing primarily on
dance.Specific techniques and approaches towards generating site
inspired choreography, developed over the last 25 years by site artist Stephan
Koplowitz will be introduced. Aspects of navigating technical issues (lighting,

covered.
prereq: This course is designed for anyone interested in learning about site-specific dance and performance and how toperformance works outside of the proscenium stage. Priorin dance or theater is not required but prior experience in creating dance, theater or performance is recommended.
summary: This course will look into the process of creating live site-specific choreography/performance works from conception, production to performance. Site-specific dance/performance is work created in response to a particular place, site, inspired by its architecture/design, the history and current use.

galement de montrer les apports de la thologie de Calvin (notamment la
comprhension renouvele dun Dieu en qui lhumain peut faire confiance)
et ses limites (par exemple la doctrine dite de la prdestination).Ce cours dintroduction fera galement une place  lhistoire du calvinisme
en Europe (France, Allemagne, Provinces-Unies, Angleterre) et dans le monde
(Amrique, Afrique du Sud, Asie).Who
was John Calvin? Why were his ideas so influential in the 16th century
and well beyond his time? This course seeks to answer these two questions.We will present his humanistic leanings, his interpretation of the Bible,
his theological vision, his acute sense of social and political questions.
We will consider his contribution to culture, how he contributed to shaping
French language, his understanding of the human before God and in society.
The course will address how Calvin sought to transform the city of Geneva
into an idea and an ideal of Christian life, by thinking the meaning of
work and money, but also by creating educational and ecclesiastical institutions
(the Company of Pastors, the Consistory and
the Academy).The course will locate Calvin within the history of religious toleration,
or rather of religious intolerance. We will analyse the fate of Michel
Servet, a learned Spanish man who was condemned for heresy and executed
in Geneva in 1553. With regard to Calvins theology, we will show both
his lasting contribution (especially his understanding of a God in whom
one may trust) as well as the limitations of his thought (for instance
his doctrine of predestination).Towards the end of this introductory course, we will turn our attention
to the history of Calvinism in Europe (France, Germany, the United Provinces,
England) and in various parts of the world (Americas, South Africa and
Asia).

title: Constitutional Struggles in the Muslim World
objectives: Since 2009 there has been a renewed wave of
popular unrest sweeping throughout much of the Muslim world. Secular, but
generally repressive and inefficient autocracies have come under pressure or
been swept aside entirely. At the same, the various Islamic Republics have not
fared much better, but been convulsed by internal unrest, economic and social
decline. Throughout the Muslim lands, existing constitutional arrangements are
being challenged, often very violently.Three common themes will characterise the course:Ultimately, the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary discourse about the, better contextualise the demands for religious law in public life, and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular model of governance.
prereq: By choice and necessity, this course will
be interdisciplinary and has no prerequisites. No knowledge of Arabic or other
Oriental languages is assumed; neither is
previous familiarity with the study of religion in general and Islamic
beliefs in particular; nor with the legal method in general and constitutional
law in particular. Rather than assuming a common frame of reference, it is
expected that students diverse disciplinary backgrounds will complement each
other.
summary: Learn what motivates the restive Muslim youth from Cairo to Tehran, what political positions Islamists from Mali to Chechnya are fighting for, where the seeming obsession with Islamic law comes from, where the secularists have vanished to, and whether it makes sense to speak of an Islamic state.

title: Conditions of War and Peace
objectives: Discourse on war and peace has gone through a remarkable transition during
    the two decades after the end of the Cold War. We do not have to worry
    of major nuclear wars, and then, no longer can we anticipate stability
    based on nuclear deterrence. We have no immediate threat emanating from
    a belligerent adversary equipped with a major arsenal, but we observe a
    number of small to medium military powers that are more belligerent than
    the days of the Soviet Union. We have more democracies in the world, and
    yet are far from the democratic peace that has been imagined by the students
    of international relations.This course aims to nail down some of the basic issues that had been argued
    in the current research on peace and security. The questions are all deceptively
    simple enough, but then the answers will all be ambiguous at best. It is
    my hope that you will be able to provide better answers than those given
    in the course by developing your own analytical capacity.

summary: Este curso introduce a los estudiantes de grado de habla hispana en los aspectos ms relevantes de la lengua, la historia y la cultura del Egipto de los faraones.
title: Sren Kierkegaard - Subjectivity, Irony and the Crisis of Modernity
objectives: It is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are typically
    modern philosophical problems that emerge with the breakdown of traditional
    values, customs and ways of life. The result is the absence of meaning,
    the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread
    in modernity.The Danish thinker Sren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one of the most penetrating
    analyses of this complex phenomenon. But somewhat surprisingly he seeks
    insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in an ancient one,
    the Greek philosopher Socrates.
prereq: 
summary: In this course we will explore how Kierkegaard deals with the problems associated with relativism, the lack of meaning and the undermining of religious faith that are typical of modern life. His penetrating analyses are still highly relevant today and have been seen as insightful for the leading figures of Existentialism, Post-Structuralism and Post-Modernism.

title: Global Health: Interdisciplinary Overview
objectives: Course instructors: Prof. Antoine Geissbuhler, MD and Prof. Louis Loutan,
MDCourse director: Dr Samantha Battams, PhDCourse coordinators: Dr Slim Slama, MD and Dr Didier WernliCourse assistant: Dr Rafael Ruiz De Castaneda, PhDIn our globalizing world, Infectious diseases travel quickly and widely
across countries, so do the large determinants of chronic diseases resulting
in a growing burden in developed but also developing countries. Issues
in traditionally non health sector such as Climate change or trade governance
can have dramatic and worldwide effects on health and health systems.These short examples illustrate what Global health is about: issues
that not only cross national boundaries but also disciplinary territories.
In our interdependent world, more and more health issues cannot be addressed
by a country nor by a sector alone and require collaboration, coordination
and integration.
prereq: No background is required; all are welcome!
summary: This course proposes an overview of current global health challenges drawing on the insights of several academic disciplines including medicine, public health, law, economics, social sciences and humanities. This interdisciplinary approach will guide the student into seven critical topics in global health.
title: Live!:  A History of Art for Artists, Animators and Gamers
objectives: This course approaches the questions of art and history
from the perspective of contemporary makers of art (sculpture, painting,
photography, performance, installation and more), animators (whether
character/story-based or experimental) and gamers, asking how artists actively
make a history for their own practices by thinking about the creative process
as a conversation with a wide range of art from the past. Why are ground-breaking artists so often
historically-minded (and yet tend to break all the rules of conventional
history-telling)? How do animators
themselves write the largely unwritten history of their art through
quotation, transposition and mash-ups?
Why should contemporary gamers look at classical painting anyway?This course will combine short video lectures/interviews and
interactive quizzes with independent, peer-reviewedsketchbook and field work (suggested visits to
local museums, film viewings, etc.). It is
intended to give the student a background in a wide range of visual practices and
a greater familiarity with techniques of historical analysis. It will help to build skills in visual
analysis, and will also provide insight into the creative culture of CalArts,
where a certain portion of these art histories have been made in the first
place.
prereq: This class will consist of video lectures (about 10 minutes in length) combined with videointerviews with guest artists and virtual "field trips" to artist studios and workplaces, museums and galleries. Lectures will focus on key topics, including "story," "character," "language," "time," "dimensionality," "novelty," etc., exposing students to a wide range of art from around the world.Students will be required to keep a sketchbook, complete "looking, thinking and making" assignments for peer assessment. A final exam will test comprehension of key concepts.
summary: Explore art history from the artist's perspective.  Learn how contemporary artists, animators and gamers work from the art of the past as part of their creative process, while building your own skills in visual analysis and creative and critical thinking.

title: Introduction to Programming for Musicians and Digital Artists
objectives: The course, lecture, and examples build on each other to teach the fundamentals
    of programming in general (logic, loops, functions, objects, classes) and
    also deals with advanced topics including multi-threading, events and signals.
    Throughout the course, students create meaningful and rewarding expressive
    digital instruments that make sound and music in direct response to program
    logic. The ChucK language provides precise high-level control over
    time, audio computation, and user interface elements (track pad, joysticks,
    etc.). ChucK is used (unknowingly in most cases, via SMule Apps)
    by millions of users throughout the world, and is the backbone of dozens
    of academic programs and laptop orchestras. Learning to program using
    ChucK, through the musical examples provided in this course, will prepare
    students to program in C++, Java, and other languages. There will be special
    guest lectures from creators of the ChucK language, Dr.Ge Wang (Stanford
    University) and Dr. Perry R.Cook (Princeton University).
prereq: Yes. Students who successfully complete the class will receive a Statement
    of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.
summary: This course provides a complete introduction to programming for digital musicians and
artists, in the real-time multimedia language ChucK. Rich with practical examples and
pointers to additional web resources, it can be understood by novices wishing to learn to
program interactive arts systems.   

title: Epidemiology: The Basic Science of Public Health
objectives: Often called the cornerstone of public health, epidemiology is the study
of the distribution and determinants of health conditions or events among
populations and the application of that study to control health problems.
By applying the concepts learned in this course to current public health
problems and issues, students will understand the practice of epidemiology
as it relates to real life and makes for a better appreciation of public
health programs and policies. This course explores public health
issues like obesity and infectious diseases  both locally and globally
through the lens of epidemiology.
prereq: This course is for anyone interested in learning about public health and
epidemiology. It is targeted towards a broad audience of English speaking
adult and young adult learners at a level such that it would be suitable
for anyone capable of performing at-or-above college level work.
summary: This course explores public healthboth locally and globallythrough the lens of epidemiology.
title: Creating Site-Specific Dance and Performance Works
objectives: This course will look into the process of creating live
site-specific choreography/performance works from conception, production to
performance. Site-specific dance/performance is work created in response to a
particular place, site, inspired by its architecture/design, the history and
current use. We will investigateurban, architectural and
environmental inspired site projects ranging from large-scale to small
(guerrilla) style productions. We willdelineate definitions of
site-specificity, andlook across the history of the field, focusing primarily on
dance.Specific techniques and approaches towards generating site
inspired choreography, developed over the last 25 years by site artist Stephan
Koplowitz will be introduced. Aspects of navigating technical issues (lighting,
sound, media) including a primer on producing (budgeting, obtaining
permissions, insurance, fundraising, audience/event design) willalsobe
covered.
prereq: This course is designed for anyone interested in learning about site-specific dance and performance and how toperformance works outside of the proscenium stage. Priorin dance or theater is not required but prior experience in creating dance, theater or performance is recommended.

    with several fun and easy to understand examples.This course is, quite literally, for everyone. If you think you can't
    learn statistics, this course is for you. If you had a statistics course
    before but feel like you need a refresher, this course is for you. Even
    if you are a relatively advanced researcher or analyst, this course provides
    a foundation and a context that helps to put ones work into perspective.Statistics One also provides an introduction to the R programming language.
    All the examples and assignments will involve writing code in R and interpreting
    R output. R software is free! What this means is you can download R, take
    this course, and start programming in R after just a few lectures. That
    said, this course is not a comprehensive guide to R or to programming in
    general.
prereq: Anyone and everyone is welcome to take this class. Proficiency in algebra
is helpful but not necessary.
summary: Statistics One is a comprehensive yet friendly introduction to statistics.

    the symptoms of disease. In fact, Gregory Higby of the American Institute
    of the History of Pharmacy has writtenthat, ...the very concept
    of influencing bodily functions via an outside force must be considered
    one of humanitys greatest advances. Since its independentorigins
    in ancient Arabic civilizations, pharmacy has evolved from a craft dedicated
    to the compounding of drugs to a profession focusing on helping patients
    get the best outcomes from medication therapies.So what is pharmacy? How has it changed and where is it headed?This course will answer these questions and provide a comprehensive introduction
    to this profession. We will explore the history of pharmacy and its evolving
    scope of practice; examine educational and career pathways; tackle issues
    relating to medication safety and adverse drug events; gain insight into
    the regulatory and ethical considerations in pharmacy practice; and more.As we explore these topics together, we will hear from practicing pharmacists
    throughout the course and ultimately gain a better understanding of what
    they do and how they help us get the best results from our medications.
    Maybe you will decide that the dynamic profession of pharmacy is a career
    path that you want to pursue! Whether student or healthcare consumer,
    youre sure to find the material we cover in this course to be invaluable.

title: Modern & Contemporary American Poetry
objectives: In this fast-paced course we will read and encounter and discuss a great range of modern and contemporary U.S. poets working in the "experimental mode," starting with the 19th-century proto-modernists Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and ending with 21st-century conceptual poetics. Aside from providing a perhaps handy or helpful survey and chronology of 20th- and 21st-century poetry, this course offers a way of understanding general cultural transitions from modernism to postmodernism. Some people may wish to enroll as much to gain an understanding of the modernism/postmodernism problem through a study of poetry as to gain access to the work of these many poets. Participants do not need to have any prior knowledge of poetry or poetics. The instructor, Al Filreis, rarely lectures, and frequently calls for "the end of the lecture as we know it"; instead, most of the video-recorded lessons will consist of collaborative close readings led by Filreis, seminar-style -- offering models or samples of readers' interpretations of these knotty but powerful poems, aided by the poetry-minded denizens of the Kelly Writers House on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania.

objectives: We have learned a lot recently about how the Universe evolved in 13.7 
billion years since the Big Bang. More than 80% of matter in the 
Universe is mysterious Dark Matter, which made stars and galaxies to 
form. The newly discovered Higgs-boson became frozen into the Universe a
 trillionth of a second after the Big Bang and brought order to the 
Universe. Yet we still do not know how ordinary matter (atoms) survived
 against total annihilation by Anti-Matter. The expansion of the 
Universe started acceleration about 7 billion years ago and Universe is 
being ripped apart. The culprit is Dark Energy, a mysterious energy 
multiplying in vacuum. I will present evidence behind these startling 
discoveries and discuss what we may learn in the near future.

title: The Role of Renminbi (RMB) in the International Monetary System
objectives: Despite the rapid growth of the Chinese economy, the RMB is still not ready to be an international currency. For the RMB to be an international currency, Chinas financial markets should be conceptually well developed. Further, China will have to build up the credibility that the Central Bank can maintain the stability of its currency and ensure full convertibility of the RMB.This self-contained course will discuss our policy views on various topics of RMB internationalization. Specifically, we will provide innovative suggestions on increasing the autonomy of the Peoples Bank of China (PBC), implementing an inflation targeting policy, developing securities markets for corporate borrowing, establishing a flexible and market-determined exchange rate, removing restrictions on capital control, and improving the legal infrastructure and regulations for financial markets. Since the internationalization of Renminbi is of major importance to the further development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre, we will also discuss how this process affects Hong Kong and other Asian economies.

title: Neuroethics
objectives: My course on Neuroethics originally scheduled for this spring has been postponed until September. I recognize that this will be an inconvenience for some and for that I apologize, but teaching an online course is a new experience for me, as taking one is for many of you, and as I've been preparing the sessions I have discovered that there is some fine-tuning to be done. Since I don't want to compromise on quality I hope you will all understand and bear with me. -- Jonathan D. Moreno, Ph.D.Perhaps a man really dies when his brain stops, when he loses the power to take in a new idea. --George OrwellNeuroethics might well be the most rapidly growing area within bioethics; indeed, in some respects neuroethics has grown as an independent field, with its own journals, professional society and institutional centers. This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that (a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications. This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience. Irrespective of their validity, even the claims that modern neuroscience entails the re-examination of complex and sensitive topics like free will, consciousness, identity, and responsibility raises significant ethical issues. As such, neuroethics asks questions that extend beyond the usual umbrella of biomedical ethics. This course will, therefore, consider the new knowledge and ways of learning about the brain from scientific and ethico-legal and social standpoints. We will examine the core themes of neuroethics, including cognitive enhancement, the nature of the self and personhood, neuroimaging and privacy, and the ways that all these themes are brought together in matters affecting national security.
prereq: 
summary: This course will examine the ethical, legal and social issues raised by neuroscience. Topics will include the implications of new knowledge of the brain for our understanding of selfhood, for the meaning of privacy, for the distinction between therapy and enhancement, and for national security.

objectives: If you use nearly any digital technology, you make use of metadata. Use
an ATM today? You interacted with metadata about your account. Searched
for songs in iTunes or Spotify? You used metadata about those songs. We
use and even create metadata constantly, but we rarely realize it. Metadata
-- or data about data -- describes real and digital objects, so that those
objects may be organized now and found later.Metadata is a tool that enables the information age functions performed
by humans as well as those performed by computers. Metadata is important
to many fields, particularly Computer Science; but this course is not purely
a Computer Science course. This course approaches Metadata from the perspective
of Information Science, which is a broad interdisciplinary field that studies
how people create and manage information.
prereq: Knowledge of HTML or HTML5 is a prerequisite for this course. If you are
unsure if you meet this prerequsite, we recommend that you score at least
15 out of 20 on the.
If you find that you do not have this level of knowledge of HTML, many
free online resources are available, including:
summary: Metadata is an unsung hero of the modern world, the plumbing that makes the information age possible. This course describes how Metadata is used as an information tool for the Web, for databases, and for the software and computing applications around us.

We will examine the core themes of neuroethics, including cognitive enhancement, the nature of the self and personhood, neuroimaging and privacy, and the ways that all these themes are brought together in matters affecting national security.
prereq: 
summary: This course will examine the ethical, legal and social issues raised by neuroscience. Topics will include the implications of new knowledge of the brain for our understanding of selfhood, for the meaning of privacy, for the distinction between therapy and enhancement, and for national security.
title: Metadata: Organizing and Discovering Information
objectives: If you use nearly any digital technology, you make use of metadata. Use
an ATM today? You interacted with metadata about your account. Searched
for songs in iTunes or Spotify? You used metadata about those songs. We
use and even create metadata constantly, but we rarely realize it. Metadata
-- or data about data -- describes real and digital objects, so that those
objects may be organized now and found later.Metadata is a tool that enables the information age functions performed
by humans as well as those performed by computers. Metadata is important
to many fields, particularly Computer Science; but this course is not purely
a Computer Science course. This course approaches Metadata from the perspective
of Information Science, which is a broad interdisciplinary field that studies
how people create and manage information.
prereq: Knowledge of HTML or HTML5 is a prerequisite for this course. If you are
unsure if you meet this prerequsite, we recommend that you score at least
15 out of 20 on the.
If you find that you do not have this level of knowledge of HTML, many
free online resources are available, including:
summary: Metadata is an unsung hero of the modern world, the plumbing that makes the information age possible. This course describes how Metadata is used as an information tool for the Web, for databases, and for the software and computing applications around us.

title: History of Rock, Part Two
objectives: This course, part 2 of a 2-course sequence, examines thehistory of rock, primarily as it unfolded in the United States,from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. This course covers the music of Led Zeppelin, the Allman Brothers, Carole King, Bob Marley, the Sex Pistols, Donna Summer, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Metallica, Run-DMC, and Nirvana,and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments inthe music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.Emerging out of the experimental and ambitious years of late-60s psychedelia, rock splintered into a variety of styles in the 1970s as the music business continued to expand. By the end of the decade, punk and disco had challenged the excesses of thehippie aesthetic, as rock became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly. The emergence and rise of MTV transformed pop music and propelled the careers of Michael jackson and Madonna, while heavy metal and hip hop dominated the late 1980s. Nirvana leads alt-rock'sreturn to simplicity in the early 1990s.
prereq: No previous trainingin music is required.
summary: Learn about the growth of rock music, from the early 1970s through the rise of punk and disco in the late 1970s, and from the emergence of MTV, hip hop, and heavy metal in 1980s to the rebellion of Nirvana in the early 90s.

title: Volcanic Eruptions: a materials science.
objectives: Geoscientists define
a living planet as one with active volcanism. By this definition our Earth is
very much alive, with many eruptions each year and with a far greater number of
active volcanoes that can potentially erupt in any given year.In detail, each eruption is
different. Every volcano is its own physical and chemical system, occurs in its
own geological location, is subjected to its local stress field, and is at its
own stage in evolution in geological time.
External triggers of volcanic eruptions are also believed to play an
important role.Yet powerful generalisations
and models of volcanic eruptions are indeed possible and in fact very useful in
dealing with the consequences of volcanic eruptions.How are such models
constructed? They must rest on a basis of a mechanistic understanding of what
volcanoes are, and what they are doing  not just during eruptions but also in
the events leading up to eruptions, and not just at the Earths surface but
also at depth, where the magma is being prepared for the next eruption.In addition to
field observations of past eruptions, monitoring of signals from magmatic
systems, and computer-based simulation of volcanic eruptions, increasingly,
high pressure and high temperature experiments are employed in order to answer
the question of how volcanic systems work.These controlled laboratory conditions
for experimental volcanology are transforming the study of volcanoes from a
chiefly observational discipline where eruptive mechanisms were developed via
theoretical analysis of such observations, into a fully modern scientific
discipline where such theoretical approaches are either verified or rejected,
by the experimental picture of what is possible and what is not.This course shows you how such experimental insight isobtained and what it tells us about erupting volcanoes.
prereq: 
summary: Volcanic eruptions are a powerful demonstration of the energy of the Earths interior. A materials-based understanding of the evolution of erupting systems provides a quantitative physico-chemical description of the nature of lava and magma and the role of experiments in quantifying the eruptive process.

title: Programmed cell death
objectives: In this
course, you will learn about the conserved, molecular machinery that eliminates
cells through programmed cell death type I, also referred to as apoptosis.
Through apoptosis many cells are eliminated from our body during development
and throughout adult life, and deregulated apoptosis can lead to various
diseases such as cancer and auto-immune diseases. Rather than just telling you
about the molecular machinery of apoptosis and how it works to kill cells, I
will walk you through and discuss with you the critical experiments that led to
the discovery of the key components of this molecular machinery and the
mechanisms through which they function.I will also
discuss how apoptosis research can help to develop noveltherapeutics
and consider the questions that remain open in
the field.The course
will cover the following topics:1.
Introduction
to programmed cell death and apoptosis2.
The
BCL-2 family of proteins3.
Apaf
proteins4.
Caspases5.
Mechanisms
that regulate apoptosis6.
Non-apoptotic
functions of components of the central apoptosis machinery7.

title: Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy
objectives: Since antiquity, philosophers have questioned the foundations--the foundations of the physical world, of our everyday experience, of our scientific knowledge, and of culture and society.In recent
years, more and more young philosophers have becomeconvinced
that, in order to understand these foundations, and thus to make progressin
philosophy, the use of mathematical methods is of crucial importance.
This is what our course will be concerned with:
mathematical philosophy, that is, philosophy done with the help ofmathematical
methods.As we will try to show, onecan analyze philosophical concepts much more clearly in mathematical terms, one can derive philosophical conclusions from philosophical assumptions by mathematical proof, and one can build mathematical models in which we can study philosophical problems.So, as Leibniz would have said: even in philosophy,. Let's calculate.

title: Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression
objectives: While the human genome sequence has
transformed our understanding of human biology, it isnt just the sequence of
your DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are some genes activated
and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.Epigenetics has been a hot topic for research
over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control
contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable
through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to
mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations,
epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be
manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that
epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet),
which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.This course will give an introduction to the
fundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that
are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on
mammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the
environment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.
prereq: Some background in biology, and more specifically genetics is recommended.
summary: Each mammalian cell has the same genes, yet performs distinct functions. This is achieved by epigenetic control of gene expression; the switching on and switching off of genes. This course will cover the principles of epigenetic control of gene expression, how epigenetic control contributes to cellular differentiation and development, and how it goes wrong in disease.

title: Competitive Strategy
objectives: This course
is about the behavior of companies in
competitive markets. Facing competition forces firms to look ahead and
anticipate developments: If my rivals are likely
to react to a price cut, I will have to take the expected reaction into account.
We focus on such instances of strategic
interdependencies in real business situations.
We will first study the basic concepts of game theory as a toolbox with which we will
then analyze strategic games in real-life settings. Rather than a set
of checklists of how-to-behave in a number of
prespecified situations, this course will teach you to think about business
strategy in a systematic and exciting - and
ultimately more successful - way!
prereq: The class will consist of lecture videos between 8 and 12 minutes in length. These contain 1-2 
integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone 
homeworks that are not part of video lectures, optional case study assignments, and a compulsory final exam.
summary: In this six-week course you will learn how firms behave in situations in which strategic decisions are interdependent, i.e. where my actions affect my competitors' profits and vice versa. Using the basic tools of game theory, we will analyze how firms choose strategies to attain competitive advantage.

title: Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications
objectives: When you take a digital photo with your phone or transform the image in Photoshop, when you play a video game or watch a movie with digital effects, when you do a web search or make a phone call, you are using technologies that build upon linear algebra. Linear algebra provides concepts that are crucial to many areas of computer science, including graphics, image processing, cryptography, machine learning, computer vision, optimization, graph algorithms, quantum computation, computational biology, information retrieval and web search. Linear algebra in turn is built on two basic elements, the matrix and the vector.In this class, you will learn the concepts and methods of linear algebra, andhow to use themto think about problems arising in computer science. You will write small programs in the programming language Python to implement basic matrix and vector functionality and algorithms, and use these to process real-world data to achieve such tasks as: two-dimensional graphics transformations, face morphing, face detection, image transformations such as blurring and edge detection, image perspective removal, audio and image compression, searching within an image or an audio clip, classification of tumors as malignant or benign, integer factorization, error-correcting codes, secret-sharing, network layout, document classification, and computing Pagerank (Google's ranking method).
prereq: We will link to an optional textbook (currently in the works)that covers essentiallythe same material as the course but in greater depth and with more examples and some additional topics.
summary: Learn the concepts and methods of linear algebra, and how to use them to think about computational problems arising in computer science.  Coursework includes building on the concepts to write small programs and run them on real data.

title: A New History for a New China, 1700-2000: New Data and New Methods, Part 1
objectives: Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining
    what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. The current
    understanding of human history and social theory is based largely on Western
    experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This
    course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience
    during the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of the
    new scholarship of discovery divided into three independent parts, which
    means that students can take any Part without prior or subsequent attendance
    of the other Parts. Part 1 addresses the issue of Who Gets What and covers
    sequentially inequality and education, education and social mobility, social
    mobility and wealth distribution, and wealth distribution and regime change.
    Part 2 turns to the related issue of Who Survives and includes studies
    of inequality and population behavior, population behavior and human development,
    human development and social organization, and social organization and
    social stratification. Part 3 deals with issues of identification and motivation
    and presents studies of religion and gender, ethnicity, and nationalism
    from late imperial times to the present-day.Our class eschews the standard chronological narrative arc for an analytic
    approach that focuses on specific discoveries and on how these new facts
    complicate our understanding of comparative societies, human behavior,
    and the construction of individual and group identities. That being said,
    while we do not emphasize the temporal narratives of late imperial, early
    modern and contemporary China, we of course also discuss change over time
    as China progresses from a largely domestic imperial history to the shared
    stories of imperialism and semi colonialism, communism and collectivization,
    and reform and globalization.
prereq: No requirements. Everyone is welcome.
summary: The purpose of this course is to summarize some of the new directions in Chinese history and Chinese social science produced by the discovery and analysis of new historical data, in particular archival documents and datasets, and to organize this knowledge in a framework that encourages learning about China in comparative perspective.

title: Vaccine Trials: Methods and Best Practices
objectives: Vaccines are evaluated through a series of clearly defined controlled
    studies to assess these investigational products for safety, immunogenicity
    and efficacy before they are approved for licensure. All clinical
    vaccine trials are bound by international ethical guidelines and, in the
    case of US trials, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.Good Clinical Practice is defined by the International Conferences on
    Harmonization (ICH) as: A standard for the design, conduct, performance,
    monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials
    that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible
    and accurate, and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial
    subjects are protected.Thats a tall order, so how is it done? Individuals who enroll as
    subjects in these trials play an essential role in the development and
    evaluation of new and improved candidate vaccines. They are average
    citizens who volunteer to roll up their sleeves and, in the process, make
    a tremendous difference in society. So why do they volunteer and
    what safeguards do we put in place to protect their rights, safety and
    well-being while in the trial? What are the responsibilities of the
    investigators, sponsors and ethics committees who conduct and oversee these
    trials?Along with our colleagues, we will introduce you to how GCP is applied
    in clinical vaccine trials to ensure proper and ethical scientific conduct.
    The course will use examples from real vaccine trials to demonstrate the
    application of the FDA Code of Federal Regulations and ICH GCP Guidelines
    to explore methods and best practices involved in implementing phase I
    and II vaccine clinical trials. This short course offering through
    Coursera is based on our work at the Center for Immunization Research and
    an in-depth graduate course taught at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
    of Public Health.We hope it inspires you to work in this exciting field.
prereq: The pre-requisite for this class is a basic understanding of vaccines.
    For those without this background, the CDC Epidemiology and Prevention
    of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (Pink book) is an available resource providing
    information on routinely used vaccines and the diseases they prevent!A course on Vaccines is also taught by Paul Offit through Coursera which
    may be helpful to those enrolling in this course but is not required.
summary: This course will explore the process of evaluating investigational vaccines in clinical trials including informed consent, recruitment, enrollment, safety evaluation, and quality data collection.

title: Computational Molecular Evolution
objectives: This course is about molecular evolution - the evolution of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules. The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will cover the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem.A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (, neighbor joining).Often, the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are investigating. For instance, knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified, uncharacterized, pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle, thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic treebe an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer.Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology).Topics covered:
prereq: 
summary: In this course you will learn about how and why DNA and protein sequences evolve. You will learn the theory behind methods for building and analyzing phylogenetic trees, and get hands-on experience with some widely used software packages.

and throughout adult life, and deregulated apoptosis can lead to various
diseases such as cancer and auto-immune diseases. Rather than just telling you
about the molecular machinery of apoptosis and how it works to kill cells, I
will walk you through and discuss with you the critical experiments that led to
the discovery of the key components of this molecular machinery and the
mechanisms through which they function.I will also
discuss how apoptosis research can help to develop noveltherapeutics
and consider the questions that remain open in
the field.The course
will cover the following topics:1.
Introduction
to programmed cell death and apoptosis2.
The
BCL-2 family of proteins3.
Apaf
proteins4.
Caspases5.
Mechanisms
that regulate apoptosis6.
Non-apoptotic
functions of components of the central apoptosis machinery7.
Diseases
caused by deregulated apoptosis
prereq: 
summary: Billions of cells in the body die every day. How and why do these cells die? If you want to know the answers to these questions and if you also would like to know how scientists figured them out, this course might interest you.
title: Online Games: Literature, New Media, and Narrative
objectives: Drawing on centuries
of romance narrative conventions, the twenty-first century gaming industry has
become a creative and economic powerhouse.
It engages the talents of some of our brightest writers, artists,
composers, computer engineers, game theorists, video producers, and marketing
professionals, and in 2011, it generated an estimated $64 billion in revenue. Anyone interested in todays culture needs to
be conversant with the ways this new medium is altering our understanding of
stories. Join me as we set out on an
intellectual adventure, the quest to discover the cultural heritage of online
games.
prereq: No
background in gaming is required.
Whether you are non-gamer who is interested in understanding what video games are all about, a person who loves both popular culture and
serious literature, or a guild leader who runs large raids three nights a week,
this course will challenge you to think more deeply about important issues
confronting our culture.
summary: For both newcomers and hard-core gamers who want to reflect on their passion, this course will explore what happens to stories, paintings, and films when they are turned into online games.
title: Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy
objectives: Since antiquity, philosophers have questioned the foundations--the foundations of the physical world, of our everyday experience, of our scientific knowledge, and of culture and society.In recent
years, more and more young philosophers have becomeconvinced
that, in order to understand these foundations, and thus to make progressin
philosophy, the use of mathematical methods is of crucial importance.
This is what our course will be concerned with:
mathematical philosophy, that is, philosophy done with the help ofmathematical
methods.As we will try to show, onecan analyze philosophical concepts much more clearly in mathematical terms, one can derive philosophical conclusions from philosophical assumptions by mathematical proof, and one can build mathematical models in which we can study philosophical problems.So, as Leibniz would have said: even in philosophy,. Let's calculate.
prereq: We will not presuppose more than bits of high school mathematics.
summary: Learn how to apply mathematical methods to philosophical problems and questions.
title: Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression
objectives: While the human genome sequence has
transformed our understanding of human biology, it isnt just the sequence of
your DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are some genes activated
and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.Epigenetics has been a hot topic for research
over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control
contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable
through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to
mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations,
epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be
manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that
epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet),
which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.This course will give an introduction to the
fundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that
are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on
mammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the
environment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.
prereq: Some background in biology, and more specifically genetics is recommended.
summary: Each mammalian cell has the same genes, yet performs distinct functions. This is achieved by epigenetic control of gene expression; the switching on and switching off of genes. This course will cover the principles of epigenetic control of gene expression, how epigenetic control contributes to cellular differentiation and development, and how it goes wrong in disease.
title: Competitive Strategy
objectives: This course
is about the behavior of companies in
competitive markets. Facing competition forces firms to look ahead and
anticipate developments: If my rivals are likely
to react to a price cut, I will have to take the expected reaction into account.
We focus on such instances of strategic
interdependencies in real business situations.
We will first study the basic concepts of game theory as a toolbox with which we will
then analyze strategic games in real-life settings. Rather than a set
of checklists of how-to-behave in a number of
prespecified situations, this course will teach you to think about business
strategy in a systematic and exciting - and
ultimately more successful - way!
prereq: The class will consist of lecture videos between 8 and 12 minutes in length. These contain 1-2 
integrated quiz questions per video. There will also be standalone 
homeworks that are not part of video lectures, optional case study assignments, and a compulsory final exam.
summary: In this six-week course you will learn how firms behave in situations in which strategic decisions are interdependent, i.e. where my actions affect my competitors' profits and vice versa. Using the basic tools of game theory, we will analyze how firms choose strategies to attain competitive advantage. 
title: Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications
objectives: When you take a digital photo with your phone or transform the image in Photoshop, when you play a video game or watch a movie with digital effects, when you do a web search or make a phone call, you are using technologies that build upon linear algebra. Linear algebra provides concepts that are crucial to many areas of computer science, including graphics, image processing, cryptography, machine learning, computer vision, optimization, graph algorithms, quantum computation, computational biology, information retrieval and web search. Linear algebra in turn is built on two basic elements, the matrix and the vector.In this class, you will learn the concepts and methods of linear algebra, andhow to use themto think about problems arising in computer science. You will write small programs in the programming language Python to implement basic matrix and vector functionality and algorithms, and use these to process real-world data to achieve such tasks as: two-dimensional graphics transformations, face morphing, face detection, image transformations such as blurring and edge detection, image perspective removal, audio and image compression, searching within an image or an audio clip, classification of tumors as malignant or benign, integer factorization, error-correcting codes, secret-sharing, network layout, document classification, and computing Pagerank (Google's ranking method).
prereq: We will link to an optional textbook (currently in the works)that covers essentiallythe same material as the course but in greater depth and with more examples and some additional topics.
summary: Learn the concepts and methods of linear algebra, and how to use them to think about computational problems arising in computer science.  Coursework includes building on the concepts to write small programs and run them on real data. 
title: A New History for a New China, 1700-2000: New Data and New Methods, Part 1
objectives: Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining
    what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. The current
    understanding of human history and social theory is based largely on Western
    experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This
    course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience
    during the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of the
    new scholarship of discovery divided into three independent parts, which
    means that students can take any Part without prior or subsequent attendance
    of the other Parts. Part 1 addresses the issue of Who Gets What and covers
    sequentially inequality and education, education and social mobility, social
    mobility and wealth distribution, and wealth distribution and regime change.
    Part 2 turns to the related issue of Who Survives and includes studies
    of inequality and population behavior, population behavior and human development,
    human development and social organization, and social organization and
    social stratification. Part 3 deals with issues of identification and motivation
    and presents studies of religion and gender, ethnicity, and nationalism
    from late imperial times to the present-day.Our class eschews the standard chronological narrative arc for an analytic
    approach that focuses on specific discoveries and on how these new facts
    complicate our understanding of comparative societies, human behavior,
    and the construction of individual and group identities. That being said,
    while we do not emphasize the temporal narratives of late imperial, early
    modern and contemporary China, we of course also discuss change over time
    as China progresses from a largely domestic imperial history to the shared
    stories of imperialism and semi colonialism, communism and collectivization,
    and reform and globalization.
prereq: No requirements. Everyone is welcome.
summary: The purpose of this course is to summarize some of the new directions in Chinese history and Chinese social science produced by the discovery and analysis of new historical data, in particular archival documents and datasets, and to organize this knowledge in a framework that encourages learning about China in comparative perspective.
title: Vaccine Trials: Methods and Best Practices
objectives: Vaccines are evaluated through a series of clearly defined controlled
    studies to assess these investigational products for safety, immunogenicity
    and efficacy before they are approved for licensure. All clinical
    vaccine trials are bound by international ethical guidelines and, in the
    case of US trials, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.Good Clinical Practice is defined by the International Conferences on
    Harmonization (ICH) as: A standard for the design, conduct, performance,
    monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials
    that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible
    and accurate, and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial
    subjects are protected.Thats a tall order, so how is it done? Individuals who enroll as
    subjects in these trials play an essential role in the development and
    evaluation of new and improved candidate vaccines. They are average
    citizens who volunteer to roll up their sleeves and, in the process, make
    a tremendous difference in society. So why do they volunteer and
    what safeguards do we put in place to protect their rights, safety and
    well-being while in the trial? What are the responsibilities of the
    investigators, sponsors and ethics committees who conduct and oversee these
    trials?Along with our colleagues, we will introduce you to how GCP is applied
    in clinical vaccine trials to ensure proper and ethical scientific conduct.
    The course will use examples from real vaccine trials to demonstrate the
    application of the FDA Code of Federal Regulations and ICH GCP Guidelines
    to explore methods and best practices involved in implementing phase I
    and II vaccine clinical trials. This short course offering through
    Coursera is based on our work at the Center for Immunization Research and
    an in-depth graduate course taught at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
    of Public Health.We hope it inspires you to work in this exciting field.
prereq: The pre-requisite for this class is a basic understanding of vaccines.
    For those without this background, the CDC Epidemiology and Prevention
    of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (Pink book) is an available resource providing
    information on routinely used vaccines and the diseases they prevent!A course on Vaccines is also taught by Paul Offit through Coursera which
    may be helpful to those enrolling in this course but is not required.
summary: This course will explore the process of evaluating investigational vaccines in clinical trials including informed consent, recruitment, enrollment, safety evaluation, and quality data collection.
title: Computational Molecular Evolution
objectives: This course is about molecular evolution - the evolution of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules. The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will cover the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem.A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (, neighbor joining).Often, the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are investigating. For instance, knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified, uncharacterized, pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle, thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic treebe an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer.Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology).Topics covered:
prereq: 
summary: In this course you will learn about how and why DNA and protein sequences evolve. You will learn the theory behind methods for building and analyzing phylogenetic trees, and get hands-on experience with some widely used software packages.

objectives: Hamburger or hummus? Organic or conventional? Mediterraneandiet orMcDonald's? What dietary choices are truly the most sustainable whenwe consider that what we eat affects not just our health but also theenvironment and the well-being of others?This course will provide you with an overview of our worldsfood systemand its many impacts from the individual to the global scale. Youwillgain further appreciation of the complex implications ofchoices that are madealong the foodsupply chain. Youwill be challenged to think critically about how theglobal food system mayneed to change to adapt to future economicand environmental conditions.Our worlds population is projected to grow both in numbers and in wealth in the coming decades. Meeting future food demand, and doing so in a sustainable fashion, will require that we greatly increase the amountwe produce and improve the efficiency by which it makes it to our tables.Join us as we explore todays global food system and how we might improve its sustainability for our benefit and that of future generations.
prereq: No background is required.
summary: This course explores the diversity of the foods we eat, the ways in which we grow, process, distribute, and prepare them, and the impacts they have upon our environment, health, and society. We will also examine the challenges and opportunities of creating a more sustainable global food system in the future.

url: https://www.coursera.org/course/modelthinking
title: Model Thinking
objectives: We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.
Why do models make us better thinkers?
Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.
Here's how the course will work.
For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!
prereq: , Scott E Page., John Miller and Scott Page, Jean Lave and James March
summary: In this class, you will learn how to think with models and use them to make sense of the complex world around us.

url: https://www.coursera.org/course/sysbio
title: Introduction to Systems Biology
objectives: This
course will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on
mammalian cells, their constituents and their functions. Biology is moving from molecular to modular.
As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists
of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need
to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that
act as discrete functional systems.
These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal
transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn
these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion,
proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular
and cellular systems? What are the
mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level
thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these
systems?The course will develop multiple lines of
reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads
are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that
produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstrate
how cell- level functions arise and why mechanistic knowledge allows us to
predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.
prereq: Undergraduate introductory
cell biology; familiarity with statistics
summary: An introduction to current concepts of how cellular molecules come together to form systems, how these systems exhibit emergent properties, and how these properties are used to make cellular decisions.

title: Introduction to Systematic Program Design - Part 1
objectives: Phones, diesel engines, animated newspapers, medical devices, games, political
    campaigns, medical research, mining, transportation systems, ... and so
    on, and on, and on... every day more of the world around us is at least
    partly run by computer programs. This means that being able to design programs
    - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming
    a more and more valuable skill.To build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the
    specific programming language and libraries needed, and the more general
    skill of how to design a program.This course presents athat will enable you to approach
    the design of complex programs systematically. The method will work for
    programs in this course as well as hard to design programs you develop
    in the future.Using this method you will learn how to model the information in a problem
    domain, how to structure program data to mirror that information and how
    to further structure the data to lead to a well organized program. You
    will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally
    data driven, from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach.
    The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design, and
    to test your program as you develop it.The course has a two-phase structure. In the first phase we use a simple
    teaching language to cover the core of the design method. The second phase
    consists of parallel tracks, with each track using a different popular
    programming language and focusing on a different kind of problem. This
    will help you bring the design method to whatever language and problem
    domain interests you.
prereq: A detailed description of the design method, as
well as weekly lecture notes will be available online. No textbook is required,
but the second edition of, by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt and
Krishnamurthi is valuable supplementary reading; the book is available online at no cost.
summary: This course is about learning to program well: building programs that are elegant, well tested and easy to maintain.  The course is intended for students with no programming experience, but many former students who already knew how to program have said it made them better programmers.

objectives: This course is primarily devoted to the fundamental principles of valuation. We will learn and apply the concepts of time value of money and risk to understand the major determinants of value creation. We will use both theory and real world examples to demonstrate how to value any asset.
prereq: This is a tough issue. I do not believe in prerequisites, except for a sense of curiosity and an attitude. Having said that, exposure to economics (the mother discipline of finance), accounting (the language of business), and/or algebra and statistics (we all need it) will clearly help. I will however try and cover everything starting with fundamentals and will highlight when there is a need for you to do some further work in specific subjects. In fact, I hope the class will motivate you to learn more. I believe that learning usually happens when you are motivated by a curiosity to understand something.
summary: This course will introduce you to frameworks and tools to measure value; both for corporate and personal assets. It will also help you in decision-making, again at both the corporate and personal levels.

title: Statistical Molecular Thermodynamics
objectives: Statistical Molecular Thermodynamics is a course in physical chemistry
that relates the microscopic properties of molecules to the macroscopic behavior
of chemical systems. Quantized molecular energy levels and their use in the
construction of molecular and ensemble partition functions is described.
Thermodynamic state functions, their dependence on the partition function, and
their relationships with one another (as dictated by the three Laws of
Thermodynamics) are all examined in detail. Analysis and demonstration takes
place primarily in the context of ideal and real gases. This eight-week course
covers slightly more than half of a typical semester-long course in chemical
thermodynamics. Typical topics to be addressed subsequently would be phase
equilibria, liquids, solutions of non-electrolytes and electrolytes, and
chemical reaction equilibria.Students
 who successfully complete the course will be able to predict how 
changes in molecular properties will influence the macroscopic behavior 
of those substances; they will understand the relationships between 
energy, heat, and work, and be able to predict how much work can be 
extracted from a given chemical process under various sets of 
conditions; they will understand the role of entropy in physical and 
chemical processes; and they will be able to engineer conditions to make
 chemical reactions spontaneously favorable (or not). Students will also
 become adept with differential calculus as a tool to derive and 
manipulate relationships between connected thermodynamic variables and 
state functions.
prereq: One year of college-level physics. One year of college-level general chemistry. Differential calculus of multiple variables.
summary: This introductory physical chemistry course examines the connections between molecular properties and the behavior of macroscopic chemical systems.

title: Rationing and Allocating Scarce Medical Resources
objectives: You have one liver but three patients are awaiting a liver transplant. Who should get the liver? What criteria should be used to select the recipient? Is it fair to give it to an alcoholic? These are some of the questions that arise in the context of rationing and allocating scarce health care resources among particular individuals. These are called micro-allocation decisions. There are also macro-allocation decisions that focus on how health care systems distribute resources across populations. Using the cases of organs for transplantation, the rationing for vaccines in a flu pandemic, and oncology drug shortages, the course will critically examine alternative theories for allocating scarce resources among individuals. Using both the need to establish priorities for global health aid and to define an essential benefit package for health insurance, the course will critically examine diverse theories for macro-allocation from cost-effectiveness analysis to age-based rationing to accountability for reasonableness. There are no prerequisites or required knowledge to take this course.
prereq: 
summary: This course will explore the complex challenges of allocating scarce medical resources at both the micro and macro level. Students will learn the theories behind allocation and use modern examples to explore how society makes the difficult decisions that arise when there is not enough to go around.

    dysfunction, and destitution are daily discussed by media and policy makers.
    What are individuals, families, communities and societies to make of an
    ageing world? We analyze contemporary topics in psychological and social
    ageing from a global perspective. Each week, we pose a question to be explored
    and discussed online. Participants are encouraged to contribute their experiences
    and perspectives as we create a global community to discuss age, ageing,
    and the science of gerontology in action. Participants will then compile
    a portfolio of materials they create and/or collect to address each weeks
    question and critically reflect their knowledge and experience throughout
    the course. Portfolios are then reviewed by peers at the end of the course
    to foster continued discourse among participants in our COURSERA community.
prereq: No background in ageing or related fields is required. We welcome all
for learning and dialogue on growing old and living in ageing communities
and societies.

title: Accountable Talk: Conversation that Works
objectives: Designed for teachers and learners in every setting - in school and out,
in formal learning environments or at home - Introduction tois
an introduction to the theory and practice of well-structured talk that
builds the mind. You will learn from the growing body of research and from
educators who put it into practice, why intentionally structured talk promotes
learning and how educators can design talk situations that promote learning.
The course includes video examples of children and adults engaging inin
a variety of settings and will enable you to begin to buildin
your own learning community. While theprogram was
originally developed for K-12 classrooms, its structures and practices
are readily and productively applicable to any situation in which people
get together and talk in order to learn. The course was developed by the
School of Education and the Institute for Learning at the University of
Pittsburgh. The Institute for Learning was founded by Lauren Resnick, an
internationally renowned cognitive psychologist, in 1995. Since then, under
Resnicks leadership the Institute for Learning has worked to support the
improvement of education and achievement of all students in more than 70
school districts in 23 different states.
prereq: No background is required. Anyone interested in learning the research
and proven techniques about how to build structured conversations to get
smarter or to help others get smarter is welcome.

It will address subjects such as: What is nuclear energy? What is its history? Who are its heroes? Why is it controversial? How do nuclear power plants work? What about nuclear weapons? What are the stereotypes and misconceptions? We expect many students who finish this class to want to go on for further study in a closely related field.
prereq: Students should have had a course in physics and differential equations. Simple, first order ordinary differential equations will be used now and then.
summary: This course will focus on the theory, design and operation of commercial nuclear power reactors. The course will also touch on contemporary issues regarding nuclear power generation including: the nuclear fuel cycle, the economics of nuclear power, and nuclear non-proliferation.
title: The Science of Safety in Healthcare
objectives: This course will introduce the basic principles of the science and culture
of safety in healthcare. The goals for this course are to provide definitions
and context of patient safety concepts and terms using a systems approach.
We will explore topics in the science of safety, patient safety culture,
patient centered care, and team work. With these foundational principles
as background, you will explore how to identify and mitigate risks and
develop data-driven change efforts, using human factors science and quality
improvement methodologies to guide your improvement plans. You will see
how the Comprehensive Unit-Based Safety Program (CUSP) provides one model
for achieving improved patient safety outcomes. While course content and
examples will focus on the acute-care healthcare setting, specifically
the hospital, learning will be relevant to other healthcare settings such
as extended care, outpatient, and home care settings. The content of this
course has been adapted from the Patient Safety Certificate Program offered
by the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality
as well as the Helene Fuld Fellows Program undergraduate course content
from the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing.
prereq: 
summary: This course will introduce the basic principles of the science of safety in healthcare.  Course content will be of relevance to members of the healthcare delivery team, including nurses, as well as the healthcare consumers in the general public.  
title: Model Thinking
objectives: We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.
Why do models make us better thinkers?
Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.
Here's how the course will work.
For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!
prereq: , Scott E Page., John Miller and Scott Page, Jean Lave and James March
summary: In this class, you will learn how to think with models and use them to make sense of the complex world around us.
title: Latin American Culture
objectives: This course
will develop students abilities to understand Latin American culture at both
the national and regional levels. Students will analyze the social, economic,
political, and cultural development of the region by applying modern critical
thinking to the understood history of the individual Latin American countries.
At the same time, students will study the contributions of different cultural
and ethnic groups that exist within these countries, in order to understand fully
the social complexity of what we call Latin America. Lastly, students will
evaluate the developmental needs of Latin American countries and propose
possible solutions in which individuals can act as a force for change.
prereq: No background is required; all are welcome!
summary: This course seeks to interest students in the Latin American culture by studying it from multiple perspectives.
title: Introduction to Thermodynamics: Transferring Energy from Here to There
objectives: This course will provide you with an introduction to the most powerful
    engineering principles you will ever learn: thermodynamics! Or the science
    of transferring energy from one place or form to another place or form.
    We will introduce the tools you need to analyze energy systems from
    solar panels, to engines, to insulated coffee mugs.More specifically, we will cover the topics of mass and energy conservation
    principles; first law analysis of control mass and control volume systems;
    properties and behavior of pure substances; and applications to thermodynamic
    systems operating at steady state conditions.
prereq: Students should have some background in Chemistry, Calculus, and Algebra.
summary: In this course, you will learn how to characterize the energy state of a system and the mechanisms for transferring energy from one system to another.  These are the tools necessary to understand stationary and transportation power systems from small scale, like batteries, to large scale, like nuclear power plants.
title: Introduction to Systems Biology
objectives: This
course will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on
mammalian cells, their constituents and their functions. Biology is moving from molecular to modular.
As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists
of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need
to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that
act as discrete functional systems.
These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal
transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn
these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion,
proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular
and cellular systems? What are the
mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level
thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these
systems?The course will develop multiple lines of
reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads
are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that
produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstrate
how cell- level functions arise and why mechanistic knowledge allows us to
predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.
prereq: Undergraduate introductory
cell biology; familiarity with statistics
summary: An introduction to current concepts of how cellular molecules come together to form systems, how these systems exhibit emergent properties, and how these properties are used to make cellular decisions.
title: Introduction to Systematic Program Design - Part 1
objectives: Phones, diesel engines, animated newspapers, medical devices, games, political
    campaigns, medical research, mining, transportation systems, ... and so
    on, and on, and on... every day more of the world around us is at least
    partly run by computer programs. This means that being able to design programs
    - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming
    a more and more valuable skill.To build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the
    specific programming language and libraries needed, and the more general
    skill of how to design a program.This course presents athat will enable you to approach
    the design of complex programs systematically. The method will work for
    programs in this course as well as hard to design programs you develop
    in the future.Using this method you will learn how to model the information in a problem
    domain, how to structure program data to mirror that information and how
    to further structure the data to lead to a well organized program. You
    will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally
    data driven, from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach.
    The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design, and
    to test your program as you develop it.The course has a two-phase structure. In the first phase we use a simple
    teaching language to cover the core of the design method. The second phase
    consists of parallel tracks, with each track using a different popular
    programming language and focusing on a different kind of problem. This
    will help you bring the design method to whatever language and problem
    domain interests you.
prereq: A detailed description of the design method, as
well as weekly lecture notes will be available online. No textbook is required,
but the second edition of, by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt and
Krishnamurthi is valuable supplementary reading; the book is available online at no cost.
summary: This course is about learning to program well: building programs that are elegant, well tested and easy to maintain.  The course is intended for students with no programming experience, but many former students who already knew how to program have said it made them better programmers.
title: Introduction to Finance
objectives: This course is primarily devoted to the fundamental principles of valuation. We will learn and apply the concepts of time value of money and risk to understand the major determinants of value creation. We will use both theory and real world examples to demonstrate how to value any asset.
prereq: This is a tough issue. I do not believe in prerequisites, except for a sense of curiosity and an attitude. Having said that, exposure to economics (the mother discipline of finance), accounting (the language of business), and/or algebra and statistics (we all need it) will clearly help. I will however try and cover everything starting with fundamentals and will highlight when there is a need for you to do some further work in specific subjects. In fact, I hope the class will motivate you to learn more. I believe that learning usually happens when you are motivated by a curiosity to understand something.
summary: This course will introduce you to frameworks and tools to measure value; both for corporate and personal assets. It will also help you in decision-making, again at both the corporate and personal levels.
title: Internet History, Technology, and Security
objectives: The impact of technology and networks on our lives, culture, and society continues to increase. The very fact that you can take this course from anywhere in the world requires a technological infrastructure that was designed, engineered, and built over the past sixty years. To function in an information-centric world, we need to understand the workings of network technology. This course will open up the Internet and show you how it was created, who created it and how it works. Along the way we will meet many of the innovators who developed the Internet and Web technologies that we use today.After this course you will not take the Internet and Web for granted. You will be better informed about important technological issues currently facing society. You will realize that the Internet and Web are spaces for innovation and you will get a better understanding of how you might fit into that innovation. If you get excited about the material in this course, it is a great lead-in to taking a course in Web design, Web development, programming, or even network administration. At a minimum, you will be a much wiser network citizen.
prereq: This course has no prerequisites and there will be no programming. Literally anyone can and everyone should take this course.
summary: What is the Internet? How was it created? How does it work?

title: Climate Literacy: Navigating Climate Change Conversations
objectives: This course explores the basic concepts and terms needed to understand
    the science of climate change, and the available mitigation, adaptation
    and policy options. By the end of the course, students will be able to:Tell the story of our climate, describing how interactions among
    atmosphere, ocean, land, and life lead to climatic changes at all timescalesEvaluate the likely effect of historical human fossil emissions
    and land use changes on Earths energy balance and climate.Describe the direct observations of climate change in the second
    half of the 20th century, and articulate the evidence attributing global
    warming in this time period to human causes.Assess the utility - and limits - of climate models to predict
    global and regional climate change.Articulate the demographic, economic, technological and political
    factors that influence both humans impact on the climate and humans vulnerability
    to climate change.Express an informed opinion on the scope and urgency of the efforts
    needed to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.We provide the scientific basics of climate change paired with the
    response options (mitigation and adaptation) and policy landscape. Focusing
    exclusively on the science of climate change may not allow a nuanced understanding
    of the social implications of this science. Similarly, political
    or economic analyses of climate change frequently neglect the underlying
    mechanics behind climate change thresholds, feedbacks, and the potential
    for abrupt change. This course explores linkages between climate change
    and other pressing priorities such as human health, poverty, community
    livability, economic resilience, and other environmental problems (such
    as biodiversity and water quality). We acknowledge the urgent need
    to design innovative strategies that realize multiple objectives (or co-benefits)
    simultaneously, and explore the particular capacity for sustainability
    and climate change to provide an avenue for achieving these objectives.
prereq: 
summary: Climate Literacy tackles the scientific and socio-political dimensions of climate change. This course introduces the basics of the climate system, models and predictions, human and natural impacts, mitigative and adaptive responses, and the evolution of climate policy.

    and policy options. By the end of the course, students will be able to:Tell the story of our climate, describing how interactions among
    atmosphere, ocean, land, and life lead to climatic changes at all timescalesEvaluate the likely effect of historical human fossil emissions
    and land use changes on Earths energy balance and climate.Describe the direct observations of climate change in the second
    half of the 20th century, and articulate the evidence attributing global
    warming in this time period to human causes.Assess the utility - and limits - of climate models to predict
    global and regional climate change.Articulate the demographic, economic, technological and political
    factors that influence both humans impact on the climate and humans vulnerability
    to climate change.Express an informed opinion on the scope and urgency of the efforts
    needed to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.We provide the scientific basics of climate change paired with the
    response options (mitigation and adaptation) and policy landscape. Focusing
    exclusively on the science of climate change may not allow a nuanced understanding
    of the social implications of this science. Similarly, political
    or economic analyses of climate change frequently neglect the underlying
    mechanics behind climate change thresholds, feedbacks, and the potential
    for abrupt change. This course explores linkages between climate change
    and other pressing priorities such as human health, poverty, community
    livability, economic resilience, and other environmental problems (such
    as biodiversity and water quality). We acknowledge the urgent need
    to design innovative strategies that realize multiple objectives (or co-benefits)
    simultaneously, and explore the particular capacity for sustainability
    and climate change to provide an avenue for achieving these objectives.

title: Inspiring Leadership through Emotional Intelligence
objectives: Great leaders move us through our emotions. They establish a deep emotional
    connection with others called resonance. Their own levels of emotional
    intelligence allow them to create and nurture these resonant relationships.
    They use their EI as a path to resonant leadership through mindfulness,
    hope, compassion, and playfulness. Unfortunately, most people in leadership
    and helping positions (i.e., doctors, teachers, coaches, etc.) lose their
    effectiveness over time because of the cumulative damage from chronic stress.
    But humans can renew themselves, neurologically, hormonally, and emotionally.Based on decades ofresearch into emotional intelligencecompetencies
    and longitudinal studies of their development, the course will examine
    resonance and developing "resonant leadership" capability,emotional
    intelligence, and the experiences of mindfulness, hope, and compassion.
    Using the latest in neuroscience, behavioral, organizational and psychological
    research, participants willunderstand the theory, research, and experience
    of the Positive Emotional Attractor that is an essential beginning to sustained,
    desired change for individuals, teams, organizations and communities.
prereq: There are no prerequisites for this course. However, the course will be
    conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate students, graduate
    students or professionals and executives. Therefore, for all participants,
    reading and writing comfortably in English at the undergraduate college
    level is desirable.
summary: Emotional intelligence, hope, mindfulness, and compassion help a person reverse the damage of chronic stress and build great leadership relationships. The Positive and Negative Emotional Attractors inspire sustained, desired change and learning at many levels.

title: High Performance Scientific Computing
objectives: Computation and simulation are increasingly important in all aspects of
    science and engineering. At the same time writing efficient computer programs
    to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult.
    Even laptops now have 4 or more processors, but using them all to solve
    a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce
    parallelism, and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism.
    Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic,
    computer architecture, and memory hierarchies.Although parallel computing will be covered, this isa class
    on the most advanced techniques for using supercomputers, which these days
    have tens of thousands of processors and cost millions of dollars. Instead,
    the goal is to teach tools that you can use immediately on your own laptop,
    desktop, or a small cluster. Cloud computing will also be discussed, and
    students who don't have a multiprocessor computer of their own will still
    be able to do projects using Amazon Web Services at very low cost.Along the way there will also be discussion of software engineering tools
    such as debuggers, unit testing, Makefiles, and the use of version control
    systems. After all, your time is more valuable than computer time, and
    a program that runs fast is totally useless if it produces the wrong results.High performanceis also an important aspect of high
    performance scientific computing, and so another main theme of the course
    is the use of basic tools and techniques to improve your efficiency as
    a computational scientist.
prereq: Experience writing and debugging computer programs is required :Preferably experience with scientific, mathematical, or statistical computing,
    for example in Matlab or R. (Previous knowledge of Fortran, Python, or
    parallel computing languages is not assumed.)Students should also be comfortable with undergraduate mathematics, particularly
    calculus and linear algebra, which is pervasive in scientific computing
    applications. Many of the examples used in lectures and assignments will
    require this background. Past exposure to numerical analysis is a plus.All of the software used in this course is open source and freely available.
    A Virtual Machine will be provided that can be used to create a Linux desktop
    environment (with all of the required software pre-installed) that can
    be run on any operating system using the free VirtualBox software. An Amazon
    Web Services AMI will also be provided to allow doing the course work in
    the cloud.
summary: Programming-oriented course on effectively using modern computers to solve scientific computing problems arising in the physical/engineering sciences and other fields. Provides an introduction to efficient serial and parallel computing using Fortran 90, OpenMP, MPI, and Python, and software development tools such as version control, Makefiles, and debugging.

title: Grow to Greatness: Smart Growth for Private Businesses, Part II
objectives: Most entrepreneurship courses focus on how to start a business. Few focus
    on the next big entrepreneurial inflection point: how do you successfully
    grow an existing private business? This is the focus of this Course. It
    is based on the instructor's research and thirty years of real-world experience
    advising private growth companies.This Course will focus on the common people challenges private growth
    companies face as they grow. You will study stories of how six different
    private businesses faced their growth challenges.While strategic focus and operational excellence are necessary to build
    a great growth company, they are not sufficient. Growth requires the right
    kind of leadership, culture, and people. My research clearly showed that
    many entrepreneurs struggle with personal challenges presented to them
    by growth, as well as the challenge of hiring the right people and building
    the right management team that can play well together. The research shows
    that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from
    others' experienceyou do not have to "reinvent the wheel".The Course format is story based. Each case tells a compelling story.
    You will learn from Barbara Lynch, Ryan Dienst, Steve Ritter, Randy Bufford,
    John Gabbert, and Mike Cote. In addition, each week, we will discuss a
    different content theme. In Week 3, you will engage in a Workshop where
    you will be asked to apply the Growth System Assessment Tool. You will
    have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow students to
    learn from each other as the Course progresses.You will learn how entrepreneurs must grow, too; the secret of high
    performance; people-centric leadership; how to create high employee engagement;
    how to create an internal Growth System; and how to build a senior management
    team.
prereq: You may attend this Course even if you did not take Grow to Greatness,
Part 1. The only prerequisite for this Course is an interest in learning
about how privately owned entrepreneurial businesses grow. The following
people will find this course helpful: students at all levels, private business
owners, managers of private businesses, employees of private businesses,
and people interested in growth, economic development, and job creation.
summary: This course focuses on the common human resource ("people") challenges faced by existing private businesses when they attempt to grow substantially. PART 1 OF THE GROW TO GREATNESS COURSE IS NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR TAKING THIS COURSE.

title: Generating the Wealth of Nations
objectives: If
you had been alive at the start of the eighteenth century, your material
well-being would have been much the same whichever region of the world you
lived in, and it would almost certainly have been a precarious existence. Go back 300 years before the eighteenth
century, and not much was different. But
come forward 300 years to the present, and we see a startling transformation.Incomes
in some parts of the world have increased more than ten-fold; and now it most
certainly does matter where you live  with income differentials of 50 times
between the worlds richest and poorest countries. What has changed in the past 300 years is the
development and application of new technologies at a pace unprecedented in
human history  the steam engine, electricity and the computer, to name just a
few. With these developments, for those
who have access to them, have come huge gains in living standards.In
this course well explore the spectacular (but uneven) story of economic
development  beginning with the Malthusian era, moving on to the take-off of
growth in the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence in living
standards that followed, and finishing in the present with the Global Financial
Crisis. Well cover the main episodes
and events in the development of the world economy in the past 300 years, and
have something to say about most regions of the world. As well as dealing with what happened, the
course will emphasise what is known about why  and what lessons historical
experience can provide for understanding how some countries today are so rich
yet others remain so poor.Course image: Copyright JL Brown. Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)

title: An Introduction to Operations Management
objectives: Remember the last time you went to a restaurant. What did you expect from that restaurant? You wanted to find something on the menu that you liked, you wanted the meal to be prepared according to high quality standards, you wanted to get it quickly and didnt want to pay too much money for it. Now, remember the last time you went to a doctors office or a hospital. What did you want the doctors and nurses to do? You wanted them to provide the right care for you, you wanted the care delivered with great quality, you wanted to get the care quickly, and you (or your insurance) didnt want to too pay too much for it.Put differently, the management skills that you need to run the operations of a restaurant are the same that you need to run a hospital. And these are the skills you will learn in this course. Specifically, you will learn how to improve productivity, increase responsiveness, provide more choice to the customer, and deliver higher quality standards. In short, you will learn how to analyze business processes and how to improve them. Along the way, you will learn about topics such as Lean Operations, Six Sigma, and the Toyota production system, you will hear about bottlenecks, flows rates, and inventory levels. And, much, much more.

title: Machine Learning
objectives: Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being
    explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us
    self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search,
    and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning
    is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without
    knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress
    towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective
    machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting
    them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only
    the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical
    know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new
    problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices
    in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining,
    and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning
    (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels,
    neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality
    reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in
    machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning
    and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications,
    so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building
    smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam),
    computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other
    areas.

url: https://www.coursera.org/course/mythology
title: Greek and Roman Mythology
objectives: Myths are traditional stories that have endured over a long time. Some
of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding
of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their
exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple
tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some
great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem
to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece
and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it
plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention
to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths.
Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window
on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders
that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining
stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate
these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of
the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature,
religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.
prereq: No special background is needed other than the willingness and ability
to synthesize complex texts and theoretical material. Due to some explicit
subject matter, however, the class is not suitable for students under 16
years old.
summary: This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations.

amplification, effect pedals, and sounds. Students will also learn to develop correct technique and apply theory concepts to their playing. They will have the foundational knowledge necessary to pursue most intermediate guitar courses.
prereq: No musical experience or ability to read music is required.
summary: Grasp the essentials needed to begin playing acoustic or electric guitar. You'll learn an easy approach to get you playing quickly, through a combination of exploring the instrument, performance technique, and basic music theory.  
title: Grow to Greatness: Smart Growth for Private Businesses, Part II
objectives: Most entrepreneurship courses focus on how to start a business. Few focus
    on the next big entrepreneurial inflection point: how do you successfully
    grow an existing private business? This is the focus of this Course. It
    is based on the instructor's research and thirty years of real-world experience
    advising private growth companies.This Course will focus on the common people challenges private growth
    companies face as they grow. You will study stories of how six different
    private businesses faced their growth challenges.While strategic focus and operational excellence are necessary to build
    a great growth company, they are not sufficient. Growth requires the right
    kind of leadership, culture, and people. My research clearly showed that
    many entrepreneurs struggle with personal challenges presented to them
    by growth, as well as the challenge of hiring the right people and building
    the right management team that can play well together. The research shows
    that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from
    others' experienceyou do not have to "reinvent the wheel".The Course format is story based. Each case tells a compelling story.
    You will learn from Barbara Lynch, Ryan Dienst, Steve Ritter, Randy Bufford,
    John Gabbert, and Mike Cote. In addition, each week, we will discuss a
    different content theme. In Week 3, you will engage in a Workshop where
    you will be asked to apply the Growth System Assessment Tool. You will
    have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow students to
    learn from each other as the Course progresses.You will learn how entrepreneurs must grow, too; the secret of high
    performance; people-centric leadership; how to create high employee engagement;
    how to create an internal Growth System; and how to build a senior management
    team.
prereq: You may attend this Course even if you did not take Grow to Greatness,
Part 1. The only prerequisite for this Course is an interest in learning
about how privately owned entrepreneurial businesses grow. The following
people will find this course helpful: students at all levels, private business
owners, managers of private businesses, employees of private businesses,
and people interested in growth, economic development, and job creation.
summary: This course focuses on the common human resource ("people") challenges faced by existing private businesses when they attempt to grow substantially. PART 1 OF THE GROW TO GREATNESS COURSE IS NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR TAKING THIS COURSE.
title: Generating the Wealth of Nations
objectives: If
you had been alive at the start of the eighteenth century, your material
well-being would have been much the same whichever region of the world you
lived in, and it would almost certainly have been a precarious existence. Go back 300 years before the eighteenth
century, and not much was different. But
come forward 300 years to the present, and we see a startling transformation.Incomes
in some parts of the world have increased more than ten-fold; and now it most
certainly does matter where you live  with income differentials of 50 times
between the worlds richest and poorest countries. What has changed in the past 300 years is the
development and application of new technologies at a pace unprecedented in
human history  the steam engine, electricity and the computer, to name just a
few. With these developments, for those
who have access to them, have come huge gains in living standards.In
this course well explore the spectacular (but uneven) story of economic
development  beginning with the Malthusian era, moving on to the take-off of
growth in the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence in living
standards that followed, and finishing in the present with the Global Financial
Crisis. Well cover the main episodes
and events in the development of the world economy in the past 300 years, and
have something to say about most regions of the world. As well as dealing with what happened, the
course will emphasise what is known about why  and what lessons historical
experience can provide for understanding how some countries today are so rich
yet others remain so poor.Course image: Copyright JL Brown. Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)
prereq: 
summary: A survey of the history of economic development in the world in the past 300 years.
title: Design: Creation of Artifacts in Society
objectives: See examples of student projects:
prereq: To get a feel for the style of the instructor and the material in the
    course, this book is a good place to start: Ulrich, K.T. 2010. Design:
    Creation of Artifacts in Society. University of Pennsylvania.The free digital book is available at.
summary: Combine fundamental concepts with hands-on design challenges to become a better designer.

title: Citizenship and U.S. Immigration
objectives: This course analyzes the
historical origins of citizenship and immigration in the United States and provides
an overview of modern U.S. law. Beyond
traditional notions of law, the course also includes significant elements of
immigration policy, social science, history, political theory, and ethics. One goal of the course is to provide a basic
knowledge base for students to make and influence law and policy in immigration
and citizenship.Among the questions the
course will explore:
prereq: 
summary: What does it mean for an immigrant to become a U.S. citizen? Through a background of historical and policy perspectives, this course will examine U.S. law governing how citizenship is acquired, the constitutional and international law foundations underlying immigration regulation, the role of the federal government in regulating immigration, and immigration law reform.  
title: An Introduction to Operations Management
objectives: Remember the last time you went to a restaurant. What did you expect from that restaurant? You wanted to find something on the menu that you liked, you wanted the meal to be prepared according to high quality standards, you wanted to get it quickly and didnt want to pay too much money for it. Now, remember the last time you went to a doctors office or a hospital. What did you want the doctors and nurses to do? You wanted them to provide the right care for you, you wanted the care delivered with great quality, you wanted to get the care quickly, and you (or your insurance) didnt want to too pay too much for it.Put differently, the management skills that you need to run the operations of a restaurant are the same that you need to run a hospital. And these are the skills you will learn in this course. Specifically, you will learn how to improve productivity, increase responsiveness, provide more choice to the customer, and deliver higher quality standards. In short, you will learn how to analyze business processes and how to improve them. Along the way, you will learn about topics such as Lean Operations, Six Sigma, and the Toyota production system, you will hear about bottlenecks, flows rates, and inventory levels. And, much, much more.
prereq: I expect the student pool to be made up of students that:
summary: This course will teach you how to analyze and improve business processes, be it in services or in manufacturing. You will learn how to improve productivity, how to provide more choice to customers, how to reduce response times, and how to improve quality.
title: Writing II: Rhetorical Composing
objectives: Rhetorical Composing is a course where writers exchange words, ideas,
    talents, and support. You will be introduced to a variety of rhetorical
    conceptsthat is, ideas and techniques to inform and persuade audiencesthat
    will help you become a more effective consumer and producer of written,
    visual, and multimodal texts. The class includes short videos, demonstrations,
    and activities.
prereq: Anyone who is interesting in improving their writing can take this course.
    If you have had some formal writing instruction in the past, you will likely
    find Rhetorical Composing accessible.
summary: Rhetorical Composing engages you in a series of interactive reading, research, and composing activities along with assignments designed to help you become more effective consumers and producers of alphabetic, visual and multimodal texts.

Join us to become more effective writers... and better citizens.
title: Machine Learning
objectives: Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being
    explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us
    self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search,
    and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning
    is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without
    knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress
    towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective
    machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting
    them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only
    the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical
    know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new
    problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices
    in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining,
    and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning
    (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels,
    neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality
    reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in
    machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning
    and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications,
    so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building
    smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam),
    computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other
    areas.
prereq: 
summary: Learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself.
title: Greek and Roman Mythology
objectives: Myths are traditional stories that have endured over a long time. Some
of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding
of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their
exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple
tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some
great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem
to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece
and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it
plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention
to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths.
Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window
on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders
that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining
stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate
these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of
the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature,
religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.
prereq: No special background is needed other than the willingness and ability
to synthesize complex texts and theoretical material. Due to some explicit
subject matter, however, the class is not suitable for students under 16
years old.
summary: This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations.

title: Genes and the Human Condition (From Behavior to Biotechnology)
objectives: In this class we will cover the essentials of genomics to help you better
understand your own life (know thy genome, know thyself), and how advances in
biotechnology are radically changing the scientific landscape.We will begin with some of the most basic issues
of genetics, such as the composition of genomes and how the information in them
is processed so we can get an adult human from an egg. Then well see that much
of the power of genomics is in comparisons. If I only had your genome there's
not much I could do with it. But if I lined it up against a chimpanzee genome
Id see that they are 98.5% identical. Its that 1.5% difference that we study to
determine what makes a chimp a chimp and a human a human.In the next few years youll be able
to get your genome done for a few hundred dollars, and we will look at the
challenges you might face dealing with this new self-knowledge. We shall
particularly focus on behavior. How can genes predispose some of us to be nice
and others of us to be psychopaths? We will be examining behavior as a complex
unfolding of interactions between your genome and the environment.
prereq: All
are welcome to join us in this adventure. Some previous exposure to biology
will enrich your experience with this course.
summary: To acquire an understanding of the fundamental concepts of genomics and biotechnology, and their implications for human biology, evolution, medicine, social policy and individual life path choices in the 21st century.

url: https://www.coursera.org/course/communitychange
title: Community Change in Public Health
objectives: In bringing about behavior change in public health, we often focus on
    the individual mother, student, or farmer. We should not forget the community
    structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors.
    This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote
    the publics health. We begin by examining the various definitions of community
    and the processes by which we diagnose or seek to understand the structure
    and characteristics of different types of communities. An appreciation
    of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into
    the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize
    that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected,
    we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community.
    Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating
    community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change
    and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition
    of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation
    and evaluation of any intervention. We examine the concept of participation
    in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability
    of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory
    approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed
    Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other
    essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as
    insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution,
    deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.
prereq: A basic understanding of public health program planning is helpful but
    not required.
summary: This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the publics health.

    which attempts to use one single compound to hit one target to combat the
    related disease.4. Increase understanding of the various drug discovery tools and methods
    that are used for finding, identifying and designing a new drug.5. Define and understand the regulatory responsibilities for drug discovery,
    including but not limited to, an Investigational New Drug Application (IND),
    New Drug Application (NDA), and product labeling.6. Incorporate study design methods for consideration in the design
    of clinical protocols to access safety, tolerability, and efficacy in multiple
    therapeutic areas.7. Identify the critical components for development of a commercialization
    strategy and a marketing plan to launch a new drug.
prereq: 
summary: Students will learn the process of drug discovery and development through specific examples of case studies to better understand the issues facing the challenges of delivering a new drug on the market. At the completion of this course you will be able to have a better understanding of how a small or large molecule becomes a pharmaceutical drug.

objectives: This course provides an introduction to basic computational methods for
understanding what nervous systems do and for determining how they function.
We will explore the computational principles governing various aspects
of vision, sensory-motor control, learning, and memory. Specific topics
that will be covered include representation of information by spiking neurons,
processing of information in neural networks, and algorithms for adaptation
and learning. We will make use of Matlab demonstrations and exercises to
gain a deeper understanding of concepts and methods introduced in the course.
The course is primarily aimed at third- or fourth-year undergraduates and
beginning graduate students, as well as professionals and distance learners
interested in learning how the brain processes information.
prereq: Familiarity with basic concepts in linear algebra, calculus, and probability
theory. Specifically, ability to understand simple equations involving
vectors and matrices, differentiate simple functions, and understand what
a probability distribution is. For the exercises, some familiarity with
Matlab or Octave would be useful. No prior background in neuroscience is
required.
summary: Understanding how the brain works is one of the fundamental challenges in science today. This course will introduce you to basic computational techniques for analyzing, modeling, and understanding the behavior of cells and circuits in the brain. You do not need to have any prior background in neuroscience to take this course.
