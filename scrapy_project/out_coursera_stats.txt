TUDO:Remember the last time you went to a restaurant. What did you expect from that restaurant? You wanted to find something on the menu that you liked, you wanted the meal to be prepared according to high quality standards, you wanted to get it quickly and didnt want to pay too much money for it. Now, remember the last time you went to a doctors office or a hospital. What did you want the doctors and nurses to do? You wanted them to provide the right care for you, you wanted the care delivered with great quality, you wanted to get the care quickly, and you (or your insurance) didnt want to too pay too much for it.Put differently, the management skills that you need to run the operations of a restaurant are the same that you need to run a hospital. And these are the skills you will learn in this course. Specifically, you will learn how to improve productivity, increase responsiveness, provide more choice to the customer, and deliver higher quality standards. In short, you will learn how to analyze business processes and how to improve them. Along the way, you will learn about topics such as Lean Operations, Six Sigma, and the Toyota production system, you will hear about bottlenecks, flows rates, and inventory levels. And, much, much more.

TUDO:Growing old is discussed today in ominous terms  concerns about disease,    dysfunction, and destitution are daily discussed by media and policy makers.    What are individuals, families, communities and societies to make of an    ageing world? We analyze contemporary topics in psychological and social    ageing from a global perspective. Each week, we pose a question to be explored    and discussed online. Participants are encouraged to contribute their experiences    and perspectives as we create a global community to discuss age, ageing,    and the science of gerontology in action. Participants will then compile    a portfolio of materials they create and/or collect to address each weeks    question and critically reflect their knowledge and experience throughout    the course. Portfolios are then reviewed by peers at the end of the course    to foster continued discourse among participants in our COURSERA community.

TUDO:This course will introduce the basic principles of the science and cultureof safety in healthcare. The goals for this course are to provide definitionsand context of patient safety concepts and terms using a systems approach.We will explore topics in the science of safety, patient safety culture,patient centered care, and team work. With these foundational principlesas background, you will explore how to identify and mitigate risks anddevelop data-driven change efforts, using human factors science and qualityimprovement methodologies to guide your improvement plans. You will seehow the Comprehensive Unit-Based Safety Program (CUSP) provides one modelfor achieving improved patient safety outcomes. While course content andexamples will focus on the acute-care healthcare setting, specificallythe hospital, learning will be relevant to other healthcare settings suchas extended care, outpatient, and home care settings. The content of thiscourse has been adapted from the Patient Safety Certificate Program offeredby the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Qualityas well as the Helene Fuld Fellows Program undergraduate course contentfrom the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing.

TUDO:Asindividuals we are defined by relationships, by our connection to people,places, and things. Such connectedness can be not only emotional and erotic butalso political, environmental, and even textual, enacted through writing. Inthis course we explore the nature and meaning of such connections in tenmajor works of narrative fiction from the 18th century to thepresent. These include:by Abb Prvost; two works by Herman Melville,and; Charlotte Brontsand three stories by FranzKafka, Metamorphosis, In the Penal Colony, and The Country Doctor;Virginia Woolfsand William Faulkners; an anthology of stories,, by Jorge LuisBorges andby TarjeiVesaas; Tony Morrisonsandby J.M.

TUDO:We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one.Why do models make us better thinkers?Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life.Here's how the course will work.For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a certificate of completion. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!

TUDO:Thiscourse will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused onmammalian cells, their constituents and their functions. Biology is moving from molecular to modular.As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop listsof molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we needto understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules thatact as discrete functional systems.These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signaltransduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turnthese processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion,proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellularand cellular systems? What are themechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-levelthinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand thesesystems?The course will develop multiple lines ofreasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threadsare: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments thatproduce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstratehow cell- level functions arise and why mechanistic knowledge allows us topredict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.
Phrase:  Thiscourse will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused onmammalian cells, their constituents and their functions
Phrase:   Biology is moving from molecular to modular
Phrase:  As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop listsof molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we needto understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules thatact as discrete functional systems
Phrase:  These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signaltransduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability
Phrase:   In turnthese processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion,proliferation and action potentials
Phrase:   What are the properties of such subcellularand cellular systems? What are themechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-levelthinking?

This means that being able to design programs    - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming    a more and more valuable skill.To build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the    specific programming language and libraries needed, and the more general    skill of how to design a program.This course presents athat will enable you to approach    the design of complex programs systematically.

You    will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally    data driven, from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach.    The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design, and    to test your program as you develop it.The course has a two-phase structure. In the first phase we use a simple    teaching language to cover the core of the design method. The second phase    consists of parallel tracks, with each track using a different popular    programming language and focusing on a different kind of problem. This    will help you bring the design method to whatever language and problem    domain interests you.

TUDO:The impact of technology and networks on our lives, culture, and society continues to increase. The very fact that you can take this course from anywhere in the world requires a technological infrastructure that was designed, engineered, and built over the past sixty years. To function in an information-centric world, we need to understand the workings of network technology. This course will open up the Internet and show you how it was created, who created it and how it works. Along the way we will meet many of the innovators who developed the Internet and Web technologies that we use today.After this course you will not take the Internet and Web for granted. You will be better informed about important technological issues currently facing society. You will realize that the Internet and Web are spaces for innovation and you will get a better understanding of how you might fit into that innovation. If you get excited about the material in this course, it is a great lead-in to taking a course in Web design, Web development, programming, or even network administration. At a minimum, you will be a much wiser network citizen.

TUDO:Fantasy is a key term both in psychology and in the art and artifice ofhumanity. The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, andoften shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy taleto kiddie lit to myth; from "Cinderella" toto;from building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as wholesocieties. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistentneeds and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itselfin many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairygodmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practicalviewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction,fromto, is the most important in our modernworld because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profoundways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind,shape not only our world but our very hopes and fears.

TUDO:When we look at the research about what teachers actually do each day    that makes a difference in childrens lives, theres clear evidence that    its the daily interactions that teachers have with children that are most    important. And we know quite a bit about the specific type of interactions    that lead to childrens development and learning. So this course    focuses on those interactions. By the end of the course, you should    have a deep knowledge and understanding of the types of interactions that    foster learning and development among your students.What do you need toto be a really effective early childhood    teacher? Teachers need many types of knowledge  knowledge about childrens    development, about the content theyre teaching, about effective teaching    practices, about the needs and abilities of the children in their classrooms,    and about themselves. In this course well focus a bit on knowledge about    childrens development and well spend lots of time focused on knowledge    about specific types of classroom interactions that promote learning and    development.Another part of effective teaching is. All the knowledge    in the world about effective teaching is only a piece of the puzzle. Good    teachers need to see what effective teaching looks like  in lots of different    types of classrooms, with lots of different types of children. Teachers    tell us they dont get nearly enough opportunities to see other teachers    teach and they report how helpful these experiences are when they do get    them. Well spend lots of time in this course focused on observing classroom    videos and well also ask you to spend some time watching yourself teach.Ultimately we cant learn to be an effective teacher without practice     we need to spend some timeenacting the teaching practices    that well learn about. Just as young children need to do things to really    learn about them  you need to spend some time practicing the types of    interactions well be talking about.Theres one last important element to being an effective teacher. Effective    teachers spend timeon their practice. We think of this    a bit like taking time to really look at your teaching through a magnifying    glass  well give you time to reflect on your teaching and what you have    learned throughout this course.Much of this course is based on the research of Drs. Robert Pianta, Bridget    Hamre and many colleagues UVA and other institutions using the Classroom    Assessment Scoring System  or CLASS(). CLASS is an observational measure    used in research and practice that defines specific elements of effective    teaching. In this course you will see examples of the kinds of teaching    practices assessed by the CLASS. And you will get opportunities to observe    and analyze your own teaching practice in ways that have been shown to    increase the effectiveness of teachers' interactions with young children.

TUDO:Qui tait Jean Calvin? Pourquoi ses ides ont-elles exerc une telleinfluence au 16e sicle et dans les sicles suivants? Ce cours cherchera rpondre  ces deux questions.Il mettra en vidence lhumanisme de Calvin, sa comprhension de la pensebiblique, son acuit thologique, son sens aigu des problmes sociaux etpolitiques. Nous aurons aussi loccasion dvoquer lapport de Calvin la culture (notamment  la langue franaise, qui lui doit considrablement)et  la conception de lhumain devant Dieu et dans la socit. Nous verronsgalement comment Calvin fit de Genve la capitale dune ide et dun idalde vie chrtienne, en pensant le rapport au travail et  largent ou encrant des institutions comme la Compagnie des pasteurs, le Consistoireet lAcadmie.Ce cours mettra galement en vidence la place que Calvin occupe danslhistoire de la tolrance, ou plutt de lintolrance, religieuse:laffaire Servet (du nom de ce savant espagnol condamn  mort  Genvepour hrsie) fera ainsi lobjet dune analyse spcifique. Nous tenteronsgalement de montrer les apports de la thologie de Calvin (notamment lacomprhension renouvele dun Dieu en qui lhumain peut faire confiance)et ses limites (par exemple la doctrine dite de la prdestination).Ce cours dintroduction fera galement une place  lhistoire du calvinismeen Europe (France, Allemagne, Provinces-Unies, Angleterre) et dans le monde(Amrique, Afrique du Sud, Asie).Whowas John Calvin? Why were his ideas so influential in the 16th centuryand well beyond his time? This course seeks to answer these two questions.We will present his humanistic leanings, his interpretation of the Bible,his theological vision, his acute sense of social and political questions.We will consider his contribution to culture, how he contributed to shapingFrench language, his understanding of the human before God and in society.The course will address how Calvin sought to transform the city of Genevainto an idea and an ideal of Christian life, by thinking the meaning ofwork and money, but also by creating educational and ecclesiastical institutions(the Company of Pastors, the Consistory andthe Academy).The course will locate Calvin within the history of religious toleration,or rather of religious intolerance. We will analyse the fate of MichelServet, a learned Spanish man who was condemned for heresy and executedin Geneva in 1553. With regard to Calvins theology, we will show bothhis lasting contribution (especially his understanding of a God in whomone may trust) as well as the limitations of his thought (for instancehis doctrine of predestination).Towards the end of this introductory course, we will turn our attentionto the history of Calvinism in Europe (France, Germany, the United Provinces,England) and in various parts of the world (Americas, South Africa andAsia).

TUDO:GGP is an interesting application in its own right. It is intellectually    engaging and more than a little fun. But it is much more than that.    It provides a theoretical framework for modeling discrete dynamic    systems and for defining rationality in a way that takes into account problem    representation and complexities like incompleteness of information and    resource bounds. It has practical applications in areas where these    features are important, e.g. in business and law. More fundamentally,    it raises questions about the nature of intelligence and serves as a laboratory    in which to evaluate competing approaches to artificial intelligence.

TUDO:This course forms a strong foundation in the understanding and design of modern computing systems. Building on a computer organization base, this course explores techniques that go into designing a modern microprocessor. Fundamental understanding of computer architecture is key not only for students interested in hardware and processor design, but is a foundation for students interested in compilers, operating systems, and high performance programming. This course will explore how the computer architect can utilize the increasing number of transistors available to improve the performance of a processor. Focus will be given to architectures that can exploit different forms of parallelism, whether they be implicit or explicit. This course covers architectural techniques such as multi-issue superscalar processors, out-of-order processors, Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processors, advanced caching, and multiprocessor systems.

TUDO:Statistics One is designed to be a comprehensive yet friendly introduction    to fundamental concepts in statistics. Comprehensive means that this course    provides a solid foundation for students planning to pursue more advanced    courses in statistics. Friendly means exactly that. The course assumes    very little background knowledge in statistics and introduces new concepts    with several fun and easy to understand examples.This course is, quite literally, for everyone. If you think you can't    learn statistics, this course is for you. If you had a statistics course    before but feel like you need a refresher, this course is for you. Even    if you are a relatively advanced researcher or analyst, this course provides    a foundation and a context that helps to put ones work into perspective.Statistics One also provides an introduction to the R programming language.    All the examples and assignments will involve writing code in R and interpreting    R output. R software is free! What this means is you can download R, take    this course, and start programming in R after just a few lectures. That    said, this course is not a comprehensive guide to R or to programming in    general.

TUDO:This history course explores how fundamental changes in film technology affected popular Hollywood storytelling. We will consider the transition to sound, and the introduction of color. Each change in technology brought new opportunities and challenges, but the filmmaker's basic task remained the emotional engagement of the viewer through visual means. We will survey major directors and genres from the studio era and point forward to contemporary American cinema. Our aim is to illuminate popular cinema as the intersection of business, technology, and art. Through film history, we will learn about the craft of filmmaking and how tools shape art.

TUDO:Man has always used external materials to help prevent, cure, or alleviate    the symptoms of disease. In fact, Gregory Higby of the American Institute    of the History of Pharmacy has writtenthat, ...the very concept    of influencing bodily functions via an outside force must be considered    one of humanitys greatest advances. Since its independentorigins    in ancient Arabic civilizations, pharmacy has evolved from a craft dedicated    to the compounding of drugs to a profession focusing on helping patients    get the best outcomes from medication therapies.So what is pharmacy? How has it changed and where is it headed?This course will answer these questions and provide a comprehensive introduction    to this profession. We will explore the history of pharmacy and its evolving    scope of practice; examine educational and career pathways; tackle issues    relating to medication safety and adverse drug events; gain insight into    the regulatory and ethical considerations in pharmacy practice; and more.As we explore these topics together, we will hear from practicing pharmacists    throughout the course and ultimately gain a better understanding of what    they do and how they help us get the best results from our medications.    Maybe you will decide that the dynamic profession of pharmacy is a career    path that you want to pursue! Whether student or healthcare consumer,    youre sure to find the material we cover in this course to be invaluable.

If you did, chances are good that you cameof age before 1981 and are a member of the last generation of humans on thisplanet to be able to say that you remember those carefree days when all youhad to worry about was getting pregnant, herpes, and a bad reputation ().On June 5, 1981 the CDC released adescribing theof what later became known as the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS.On that day human history broke into two generations: Those who can remember a time beforethe AIDS pandemic and those who can't.No matter what generation you grew up in, what we all havein common is a curiosity about AIDS.

TUDO:Natural language processing (NLP) deals with the application of computational models to text or speech data. Application areas within NLP include automatic (machine) translation between languages; dialogue systems, which allow a human to interact with a machine using natural language; and information extraction, where the goal is to transform unstructured text into structured (database) representations that can be searched and browsed in flexible ways. NLP technologies are having a dramatic impact on the way people interact with computers, on the way people interact with each other through the use of language, and on the way people access the vast amount of linguistic data now in electronic form. From a scientific viewpoint, NLP involves fundamental questions of how to structure formal models (for example statistical models) of natural language phenomena, and of how to design algorithms that implement these models.In this course you will study mathematical and computational models of language, and the application of these models to key problems in natural language processing. The course has a focus on machine learning methods, which are widely used in modern NLP systems: we will cover formalisms such as hidden Markov models, probabilistic context-free grammars, log-linear models, and statistical models for machine translation. The curriculum closely follows a course currently taught by Professor Collins at Columbia University, and previously taught at MIT.

TUDO:Financial Engineering is a multidisciplinary field involving finance and economics, mathematics, statistics, engineering andcomputational methods.The emphasis of this course will beon the use ofsimple stochastic models and optimization for portfolio optimization, derivatives pricingand risk management.Our examples will draw from many asset classes including equities, fixed income, credit, mortgage-backed securitiesand structured products. We will also consider the role that some of these asset classes played during the financial crisis. If time permits, we will also discuss other applications including real options, energy andcommodities modeling, andalgorithmic trading among others.We hope that students who complete the course will have a good understanding of the "rocket science" behind financial engineering. But perhaps more importantly, we hope they will also understand the limitations of this theory in practice and why financial models should always be treated with a healthy degree ofskepticism.

TUDO:This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.

TUDO:You pick up your iPhone while waiting in line at a coffee shop. You google a not-so-famous actor, get linked to a Wikipedia entry listing his recent movies and popular YouTube clips of several of them. You check out user reviews on Amazon and pick one, download that movie on BitTorrent or stream that in Netflix. But suddenly the WiFi logo on your phone is gone and you're on 3G. Video quality starts to degrade, but you don't know if it's the server getting crowded or the Internet is congested somewhere. In any case, it costs you $10 per Gigabyte, and you decide to stop watching the movie, and instead multitask between sending tweets and calling your friend on Skype, while songs stream from iCloud to your phone. You're happy with the call quality, but get a little irritated when you see there're no new followers on Twitter. You may wonder how they all kind of work, and why sometimes they don't. Take a look at the list of 20 questions below. Each question is selected not just for its relevance to our daily lives, but also for the core concepts in the field of networking illustrated by its answers. This course is about formulating and answering these 20 questions.This course will launch the Grand Challenge Homework (GCH) program. Throughout the course, there will be about 10 open-ended, project-like challenges (in social and technological network engineering) provided to all the enrolled students. Associated with GCH is a Industry and Investor Partners (IIP) program. About 10 leading US companies and venture capitalists in the networking industry have agreed to screen the finalists selected by the teaching staff, and then explore opportunities with the selected students to turn their ideas and prototypes into new products and companies. You pour your creativity and energy in this course, we will help create career-changing opportunities for you.The IIP companies associated with this course range from the world-renowned Bell Labs to a startup founded by the father of DSL, and from Silicon Valley VC's like USVP to university-spinoff specialist firms like Osage Partners.

TUDO:English Composition I provides an introduction to and foundationfor the academic reading and writing characteristic of college. Attendingexplicitly to disciplinary context, you will learn to read critically, writeeffective arguments, understand the writing process, and craft powerful prosethat meets readers expectations. You will gain writing expertise by exploring questions about expertise itself: What factors impact expert achievement? What does it take to succeed? Who determines success? Since personal investment yields better writing, you can select an area of expertise meaningful to you (a hobby, trade, profession, discipline, etc.) for your major writing projects, which will be drafted and revised in sequenced stages: a critical response to an argument about expertise (2pp.); an explication of a visual image (2pp.); a case study of an expert (4pp.) and an Op-Ed (2 pp.). Your writing will be central to the course as we create a seminar/workshop structure with peer response and selected instructor feedback.Two overarching assumptions about academic writing will shape our work: 1) it is transferable; 2) it is learnable. Being aneffective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions andengaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These skills are useful acrossvirtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well.Perhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspirationor genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback. This means that, withpractice, dedication, and working with others,can be an effective academicwriter and contribute your ideas to important, ongoing conversations. Let's start now.

TUDO:It is estimated that 5-8% of school-aged children and 4% of adults in the United States suffer from some form of attention deficit disorder and that the incidence of the disorder is increasing in the population. Although it is the most widely studied behavior disorder of childhood, its etiology remains unclear, its outcome is variable, and its treatment is complex and moderately successful. Advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of ADHD, pointing to key neural circuits involved in attention, behavioral control, learning, and reward maintenance that appear to be underperforming in patients with the disorder. Moreover, the etiology of this heterogeneous disorder points to the key role of genetic andenvironmental interactions during prenatal and perinatal periods. Over the past decade, new diagnostic and interventional approaches have enabled clinicians to better diagnose and treat ADHD across the lifespan, while longitudinal studies have elucidated the long-term impact of the disorder on health and adaptive functioning.This course is intended for students with a background in psychology and/or neuroscience who are interested in learning more about the complexities of ADHD from both scientific and clinical perspectives. Scientific topics covered include prevalence and epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation at different ages, impact on development (intellect, academic, speech and language, emotional self control, motivation and executive functioning), health outcomes (risk taking, accidents, injuries, driving difficulties, unintended pregnancy), co-existing conditions (anxiety, mood, substance use disorders), and etiology (genetic, pre/perinatal, neurodevelopmental, neuroanatomic, neuropsychological). Clinical topics covered include approaches to assessment, medication treatments (stimulant and non-stimulant), and non-medical interventions.

TUDO:The MOS transistor (MOSFET) is the workhorse of the microelectronic revolution. It isestimated that there are currently over1 billion transistors per human being in the world. Part of the MOS transistor's success lies in its very small size (you can fit 1,000 of them within theof a human hair!), part lies on some amazing things this devicecan do. However, the descriptions of MOS transistors in basic electronics courses cannot begin to dojustice to this device.If you want to really know how the MOSFEToperates, and how to model it, you need to study it carefully and systematically. This course will help you do just that.The course starts with a review of basic physical principles, and expands into a detailed treatment of MOS transistor phenomena, in a logical and systematic fashion, enhanced by intuitive discussions. We discuss a hierarchy of models - from the simple to the sophisticated - clearly identifying the connections between them, and encompassing many aspects of modeling, including dc, large-signal transient operation, quasi-static operation, non-quasi-static operation, small-signal operation,noise, and structural effects. We discuss the concepts on whichthe most popular CAD (computer-aided design) MOS transistor models are based.

TUDO:A modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast: billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called intellectual property or IP blocks). How do people manage to design these complicated chips? Answer: a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design. Our focus is on the key representations that make it possible to synthesize, and to verify, these designs, as they move from logic to layout.Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures.

TUDO:The Delphic Oracle is said to have had two premier injunctions: NOTHING IN EXCESS, and KNOW THYSELF. This course will be an examination of the latter injunction. Our central questions fall into two categories. First, What is it? We shall inquire into just what self-knowledge is: Is it a form of inner perception, somewhat like proprioception, by virtue of which our minds (and hearts) have internal scanners of their own states? Or should we construe self-knowledge in a way not crucially relying on a perceptual model? In that case, what other model might we use? Second, Why is it such a big deal? We shall inquire into the question why self-knowledge should be thought so important. Just what, if anything, is missing from a person lacking in self-knowledge that makes her significantly less wise, virtuous, or able than others who have this capacity? Our exploration will take us into research in Western philosophy, psychoanalysis, current experimental psychology, neuroscience, aesthetics, and Eastern philosophy as well. In aid of these investigation we will become students of our own dreams, and cultivate some meditative practices.

TUDO:The goal of the course is to help you develop a valuable mental ability  a powerful way of thinking that our ancestors have developed over three thousand years.Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics  at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box  a valuable ability in todays world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.The primary audience is first-year students at college or university who are thinking of majoring in mathematics or a mathematically-dependent subject, or high school seniors who have such a college career in mind. They will need mathematical thinking to succeed in their major. Because mathematical thinking is a valuable life skill, however, anyone over the age of 17 could benefit from taking the course.

TUDO:This course covers intermediate topics on the structure and reactivity of organic compounds with an emphasis on electronic structure, pericyclic reactions and the chemistry of heteroaromatic compounds. Mechanistic concepts and models of reactivity are developed to build intuition about how organic compounds undergo their chemical transformations. An emphasis will be placed on developing problem-solving skills using frontier molecular orbitals to prepare students to think critically about the organic chemistry of living systems (e.g., nucleic acids, aromatic and heteroaromatic amino acids, etc.). This course and Part 2are equivalent to a second-semester organic chemistry course, and these courses are especially suited for students in agricultural, nutritional and biological sciences, as well as premedical, predental, and preveterinary programs.

TUDO:Designed for non-science students, this course is a practical introduction to physics and science in everyday life. It considers objects from the world around us, identifying and exploring the scientific concepts upon which they're based. Because it starts with objects and looks within them for science, it is the reverse of a traditional physics class. Instead of the usual principle-driven physics class, How Things Work is case-study physics. In this pilot semester of How Things Work, we will explore the basic laws of motion in the context of six familiar objects or activities: (1) Skating, (2) Falling Balls, (3) Ramps, (4) Seesaws, (5) Wheels, and (6) Bumper Cars. Despite their simplicity, these topics will bring us in contact with some of the most important concepts in physics, including inertia, energy, and momentum.

TUDO:This course will cover an introduction to the atomic molecular structure of matter, similar to a typical first semester General Chemistry course. The fundamental concepts will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach developed at Rice University and utilizing a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rices Connexions project. In this approach, rather than simply telling you the concepts you need to know and then asking you to memorize them or apply them, we will develop these concepts from experimental observations and scientific reasoning. There are several reasons for using this approach. One reason is that most of us our inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there. Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive. When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes. This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes. A third reason is that this is simply more interesting. The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning. It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.

TUDO:With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge,dedication, and creativity.Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use. Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing.We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process.Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide.After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing boarda very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.We will then explore the synthesizer, a major tool within the production of contemporary music. Yes, great music can and will be created without the synthesizer, but learning how a synthesizer works will give you a language to describe sound. Music is a collaborative art form, so there is nothing more powerful than effective communication.In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.

TUDO:In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm design. You'll learn the divide-and-conquer design paradigm, with applications to fast sorting, searching, and multiplication. You'll learn several blazingly fast primitives for computing on graphs, such as how to compute connectivity information and shortest paths. Finally, we'll study how allowing the computer to "flip coins" can lead to elegant and practical algorithms and data structures. Learn the answers to questions such as: How do data structures like heaps, hash tables, bloom filters, and balanced search trees actually work, anyway? How come QuickSort runs so fast? What can graph algorithms tell us about the structure of the Web and social networks? Did my 3rd-grade teacher explain only a suboptimal algorithm for multiplying two numbers?

TUDO:This course explores the history of the modern world since Chinggis Khan. It focuses on the connections between societies from the time of the Mongol conquests and the gradual, but accelerating ways in which connections became ties of inter-dependence. The relations between societies are what will concern us. The forces pulling the world together vary from religious to economic, political to intellectual. These forces bring the world together, but they also create new divisions. Nowadays, we call this "globalization." That term has tended to emphasize the drive to worldwide integration; the view of globalization taken in this course emphasizes disintegration as well as integration. We will tackle some very basic questions: How do we explain the staggering wealth of China in the centuries up to 1750, as well as China's recent ascent? Where did the United States come from, and where is it headed? What are the significance and legacies of empire in the world? How have world wars and revolutions shaped the international system over time? What exactly is globalization, and how does today's globalization compare with the past? How has the relationship between humans and nature changed over the centuries?

TUDO:Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being    explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us    self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search,    and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning    is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without    knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress    towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective    machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting    them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only    the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical    know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new    problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices    in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining,    and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning    (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels,    neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality    reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in    machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning    and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications,    so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building    smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam),    computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other    areas.

TUDO:Myths are traditional stories that have endured over a long time. Someof them have to do with events of great importance, such as the foundingof a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and theirexploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simpletales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do somegreat deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seemto like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greeceand Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function itplays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attentionto the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths.Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a windowon the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blindersthat all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertainingstories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigatethese questions through a variety of topics, including the creation ofthe universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature,religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.

TUDO:In this class we will cover the essentials of genomics to help you betterunderstand your own life (know thy genome, know thyself), and how advances inbiotechnology are radically changing the scientific landscape.We will begin with some of the most basic issuesof genetics, such as the composition of genomes and how the information in themis processed so we can get an adult human from an egg. Then well see that muchof the power of genomics is in comparisons. If I only had your genome there'snot much I could do with it. But if I lined it up against a chimpanzee genomeId see that they are 98.5% identical. Its that 1.5% difference that we study todetermine what makes a chimp a chimp and a human a human.In the next few years youll be ableto get your genome done for a few hundred dollars, and we will look at thechallenges you might face dealing with this new self-knowledge. We shallparticularly focus on behavior. How can genes predispose some of us to be niceand others of us to be psychopaths? We will be examining behavior as a complexunfolding of interactions between your genome and the environment.

TUDO:In bringing about behavior change in public health, we often focus on    the individual mother, student, or farmer. We should not forget the community    structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors.    This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote    the publics health. We begin by examining the various definitions of community    and the processes by which we diagnose or seek to understand the structure    and characteristics of different types of communities. An appreciation    of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into    the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize    that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected,    we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community.    Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating    community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change    and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition    of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation    and evaluation of any intervention. We examine the concept of participation    in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability    of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory    approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed    Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other    essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as    insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution,    deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.

TUDO:This course is designed to help students with very little or no computing    background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.    Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer    language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera.    To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming    environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.    These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical    and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through    multiple "mini-projects" in Python. To make this class enjoyable,    these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack,    and Asteroids. When youve finished our course, we cant promise    that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will    learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while youre doing    it.

TUDO:In this course we will seek to understand Einstein, especially focusingon the special theory of relativity that Albert Einstein, as a 26-year-oldpatent clerk, introduced in his so-called miracle year of 1905. Our goalwill be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentationsof relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einsteinthe person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of histheory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einsteincome up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is themeaning of relativity? Whats special about the special theory of relativity?Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it meanto say that time is the fourth dimension? Can time actually run moreslowly for one person than another, and the size of things change dependingon their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why cant thingstravel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to thecenter of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidencethat definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Whydidnt Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?Students may choose one of three approaches to the course: a more quantitativeapproach, a more qualitative approach, or an auditing approach. The morequantitative approach will include weekly problem sets, while the morequalitative approach will include a creative project relating to the youngEinstein and/or the special theory of relativity.

TUDO:This is a course for students who are passionate about classical musicand eager to learn more about it, but who have not necessarily had anyadvanced technical training or taken any college-level music courses. Theonly prerequisite is a basic knowledge of how to read musical notation.Otherwise, no prior experience is needed; all concepts will be explainedin class, and musical terms will be defined as they arise. This coursewill focus on Western classical music of the eighteenth and nineteenthcenturies, music that exemplifies tonality, the system of major and minorkeys, including pieces composed by Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann,Chopin, Wagner, Brahms, Richard Strauss, and others. This course will telltwo competing stories about tonal music and try to reconcile them. On onehand, we will explore what all tonal pieces have in common, the sharedmusical language that makes them intelligible and allows them to communicate;on the other hand, we will try to discover what makes each piece unique,how composers bend the common language to say something new. Although thecourse will incorporate historical perspectives, it will not be a chronologicalsurvey. Instead, it will combine music theory with aesthetics, balancingprinciples of structural organization with insights into the aestheticmeaning and effects of these principles. By illustrating his lectures withhis own performances at the keyboard, Professor Korsyn will bring the musicto life.

TUDO:In this class, we will be studying, quite literally, everything in the universe. We will start with "classical" astronomy, describing the night sky and organizing what we see as was done in ancient times. We will then embark on a journey, starting here on Earth and progressing outward, to study the Solar system, the Milky Way galaxy, and the wonderful and strange objects we observe in deep space, such as black holes, quasars, and supernovae. We will end with some discussion of what scientists know today about the universe as a whole. Along the way we will introduce some of the methods, theoretical and experimental, that have been used to understand all of this, from Newton's laws, through our understanding of light and matter, to Einstein's theory of relativity, and from Galileo's telescope to WMAP.

TUDO:This course covers topics on the structure and reactivity of organic compounds with an emphasis on bioorganic chemistry and applications to life sciences. Stereochemical concepts and aspects of non-covalent interactions relevant to enzyme-catalyzed reactions are presented. The mechanistic approach of this course is designed to help students build intuition about how bioorganic compounds undergo their chemical transformations. The structure and reactivity of the major classes of bioorganic molecules - proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids - will be covered in detail. An introduction to biosynthesis will be presented, along with the use of contemporary literature and structural databases. Throughout the course, emphasis will be placed on mechanism-based problem-solving skills to help students understand and think critically about the organic chemistry of living systems. This course, orgchem2b, and its prerequisite, orgchem2a, are equivalent to a second-semester organic chemistry course; these courses are well suited for students in agricultural, nutritional and biological sciences, as well as premedical, predental, and preveterinary programs.

TUDO:"Introduction to Databases" had a very successful public offering in fall2011, as one of Stanford's inaugural three massive open online courses.Since then, the course materials have been improved and expanded, and allmaterials are available for self-study. Students have access to lectureswith in-video quizzes, multiple-choice quiz assignments, automatically-checkedinteractive programming exercises, midterm and final exams, a discussionforum, optional additional exercises with solutions, and pointers to readingsand resources. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the curriculum drawsfrom Stanford's popular Introduction to Databases course. The materialpresented here is the same as the corresponding material presented on Stanford'sClass2Go platform.Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used bymost people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a hugefraction of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunicationssystems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other softwaresystem or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information.In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of otherproperties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability,efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-levelquery languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computerscience graduates frequently cite their database class as the one mostuseful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.

TUDO:CS101 teaches the essential ideas of Computer Science for a zero-prior-experience audience. Computers can appear very complicated, but in reality, computers work within just a few, simple patterns. CS101 demystifies and brings those patterns to life, which is useful for anyone using computers today.In CS101, students play and experiment with short bits of "computer code" to bring to life to the power and limitations of computers. Everything works within the browser, so there is no extra software to download or install. CS101 also provides a general background on computers today: what is a computer, what is hardware, what is software, what is the internet. No previous experience is required other than the ability to use a web browser.Here isNick created for this class.

TUDO:Mental health and mental illness used to be something that people didnt talk about, but now it seems every time we open a newspaper we are hearing about the importance of mental health, or the consequences of mental illness. At this point in our history we understand mental illness and mental health to be largely influenced by biological factors, specifically, workings of the brain. At the same time, we have always known that social factors play a very strong role in promoting mental health and can make big differences in who gets mentally ill, who gets treated for mental illness, and how people can achieve good quality of life after a mental health diagnosis.This course is an opportunity to explore how social practices and ideas contribute to the ways in which society, families and individuals are affected by mental health and mental illness. We will look at issues like why some people think mental illness is a myth, how people think about mental health and illness in different cultures, who gets mentally ill and why, how families are affected by mental illness and what interventions are available to treat mental illness and promote mental health.

TUDO:In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for its decades-longcontribution to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy andhuman rights in Europe. War has become virtually unthinkable in the EU. Whenthe first steps towards supranational cooperation - primarily targeted atpreventing the rearmament of Germany - were made in the aftermath of World WarTwo, the Founding Fathers of the European integration construct could neverhave imagined this outcome in their wildest dreams. Over the years, thesupranational cooperation would widen - from the original European Communitiesconsisting of 6 Member States to the current Union of 27 Members  and deepen from the originally almost purely economically inspired Communities to thecurrent Union with a say in almost all areas of national competence. At thesame time, problems with the Euro have plunged the EU in one of the biggestcrises since its inception. This challenges lawmakers to tackle difficult questionsabout the continued existence of the Euro and the future direction of theEuropean integration project.This course will give the students an insight into the law of the EU, avast and fascinating area of law which forms an integral part of the legalsystems of its 27 Member States. The course is dividedinto three parts. In the first part, we will pay attention to the creation and the development of the EU, itsinstitutional structure and functioning, and the specific nature and sources ofEU law. In the second part, we will examine how EU lawimpacts on the lives of EU citizens as well as on companies that areestablished or provide services in the EU. In the final part, we will tackle Europes common currency crisis,investigating causes, effects and possible routes out of this existentialcrisis of the Union.If you are a student, lawyer, entrepreneur or simplyinterested in the EU, itsdevelopment and legal system, this course willprovide you with the foundations.The course is of interest to people bothinside and outside the European Union: EU citizens may learn how to benefitfrom the rights contained in EU life; people from other parts of the world maylearn from the EUs specific set-up, its functioning and the legal solutionsbeing applied in the European context.

TUDO:The wide range of global sports businesses constitutes a multi-billion    dollar industry. This course will examine and explain the business of sports    by analyzing the economic, legal, governance and success models in various    sports industries. The primary focus will be on American team sports but    comparative global models will be contemplated as well. We will seek    to find the answers to questions such as: what lessons can global sports    entities learn from each other? What business strategies are used to retain    the profitability of world leagues, sports teams and franchises? What lessons    can be drawn from the United States based sports models? What revised models    should new entrepreneurial leagues apply in order to achieve success? Substantive    instruction will be drawn from the likes of the Olympics, FIFA World Cup,    MLB, NFL, Premier League, various player unions, China, India, South Africa,    Brazil and much more. Ultimately, our goal is to equip the    student with a framework and tools with which to understand and evaluate    the business side of a wide range of competitive sports ventures.

TUDO:The discovery of extra-solar planets orbiting other stars has been one of the major breakthroughs in astronomy of the past decades, changing our view on the formation of planetary systems, mainly drawn from the observation of the Solar System.Today, over 860 exoplanets are known and the Kepler satellite has recently identified over 2700 additional candidates, most of them awaiting for confirmation. We have learned that exoplanets are extremely common objects in the Universe andthat planetary systems are much more diverse than originally predicted.Our knowledge about exoplanets has dramatically increased thanks to the systematic monitoring of stars in the solarneighborhood by radial velocities, photometry, microlensing,and recently direct imaging, bringing valuable constraints to planet formation theories,as well as to models of planet interior structure, and atmosphere physics. In this course, we will review the main discoveries, describing the different approaches to detect exoplanets andcharacterisetheir orbital and physical properties.

TUDO:New findings from the neuro- and cognitive sciences have the potential to inform classroom instruction and influence educational practices for children at all developmental levels. Translating this research to practice, however, is often challenging for educational practitioners. This course will offer practical application of research by linking it with the Brain-Targeted Teaching Model (BTT)a pedagogical framework for using research in the neuro- and cognitive sciences as well as research-based effective instruction to guide teachers in planning, implementing, and assessing a sound program of instruction for all learners.Participants inthe course will examine research from the brain sciences that can informeducational practice and be able to implement research findings using theinstructional framework, The Brain-Targeted Teaching Model. This modelpresents six stages, or brain targets of the teaching and learning process.The components include (1) establishing the emotional climate for learning, (2)creating the physical learning environment, (3) designing the learningexperience, (4) teaching for the mastery of content, skills, and concepts, (5)teaching for the extension and application of knowledge, and (6) evaluatinglearning. A central theme of the model is the integration of the arts to fosterretention of new information, conceptual development, and higher-order thinkingand creative problem-solving.

TUDO:Terrorism hasarguably been one of the defining factors of our age. It frequentlymakes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private business andordinary citizens. And in many parts of the world, it has been one of the mostimportant threats to peace, security and stability. But what does this exactlymean? What is the nature of this threat? Who or what is threatened, how, bywhom and why? What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impactof terrorism and make sure that terrorists do not make headlines and manage toscare us?These are just a handful of questions that willbe addressd in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on theessence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition toan exploration of this phenomenon and the difficulties in defining it. Thesecond part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorismstudies. Since 9/11 terrorismstudies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats. Butwhat has academia come up with? What theories, assumptions andconventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understandingterrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and comparedwith empirical evidence with the aim to either stress their importance or todebunk them as myths. The final part looks into the implications andpossibilities for policy making.

TUDO:1995 LISRELSince 1995, I have conducted close to a hundred large-scale structural equation workshops and am moved by Mainland Chinese students diligence and eagerness to learn.  However, China is geographically too large.  Even if I conduct free workshops at remote cities, a lot of students still cannot pay for the travel expenses to attend.  Therefore, I am now making publicly available an original web course that is used by our own students. I hope all Chinese students can now enjoy this course with plenty of exercises to monitor their learning. As most of the course content concentrates on the explanation and applications of theories, the course should be useful for students who intend to use LISREL or other software.

A practical way of making sense of the tangle of connections is to analyze them as networks. In this course you will learn about the structure and evolution of networks, drawing on knowledge from disciplines as diverse as sociology, mathematics, computer science, economics, and physics. Online interactive demonstrations and hands-on analysis of real-world data sets will focus on a range of tasks: from identifying important nodes in the network, to detecting communities, to tracing information diffusion and opinion formation.

TUDO:Computer technology has transformed how we participate in democracy. The way we cast our votes, the way our votes are counted, and the way we choose who will lead are increasingly controlled by invisible computer software. Most U.S. states have adopted electronic voting, and countries around the world are starting to collect votes over the Internet. However, computerized voting raises startling security risks that are only beginning to be understood outside the research lab, from voting machine viruses that can silently change votes to the possibility that hackers in foreign countries could steal an election. This course will provide the technical background and public policy foundation that 21st century citizens need to understand the electronic voting debate. You'll learn how electronic voting and Internet voting technologies work, why they're being introduced, and what problems they aim to solve. You'll also learn about the computer- and Internet-security risks these systems face and the serious vulnerabilities that recent research has demonstrated. We'll cover widely used safeguards, checks, and balances  and why they are often inadequate. Finally, we'll see how computer technology has the potential to improve election security, if it's applied intelligently. Along the way, you'll hear stories from the lab and from the trenches on a journey that leads from Mumbai jail cells to the halls of Washington, D.C. You'll come away from this course understanding why you can be confident your own vote will count  or why you should reasonably be skeptical.

TUDO:Learn many of the concepts that underlie all programming languages. Developa programming style known as functional programming and contrast it withobject-oriented programming. Through experience writing programs and studyingthree different languages, learn the key issues in designing and usingprogramming languages, such as modularity and the complementary benefitsof static and dynamic typing. This course is neither particularly theoreticalnor just about programming specifics  it will give you a framework forunderstanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to designcorrect and elegant programs. By using different languages, you learn tothink more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language.The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how towrite robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs  in any language.

TUDO:Principles of Public Healthintroduces the major concepts of public health and thedeterminants of health status in communities. The course emphasizes theecological model that focuses on the linkages and relationships among multiplenatural and social determinants affecting health. As a relative concept, thehealth of populations is assessed through comparisons of temporal, spatial, anddemographic dimensions of disease burden. The goal of public health is tounderstand why and how different populations carry different kinds and amountsof disease burden, and to use that knowledge for improving health by preventingdisease.Students in the course will explore successful examples inpublic health, including how scientific discoveries and regulatory policieshave both contributed to mitigate risk factors and improve health outcomes. Howsocioeconomic and cultural factors modify the effectiveness of riskintervention and disease prevention strategies. How individual actions andcollective initiatives play important roles in determining the status ofhealth. In addition, how the various methodological approaches that guidediscoveries in public health have been applied from the local scale to theglobal level.

TUDO:Earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, ice ages, landslides, floods, life evolution, plate motionsall of these phenomena have interacted over the vast expanses of deep time to sculpt the dynamic planet that we live on today. Planet Earth presents an overview of our home, from a geological perspective. We learn how the elements comprising the Earth formed in the guts of stars and supernovae, how Earth and its Solar System neighbors formed from a vast cloud of gas and dust over 4.5 billion years ago. And how the atmosphere, oceans, and rocks of our planet form and change. We will emphasize how plate tectonicsthe grand unifying theory of geologyexplains how the map of our planet's surface has changed radically over geologic time, and why as present-day geologic activityincluding a variety of devastating natural disastersoccur where they do. We will also discuss the fascinating interactions and exchanges that take place among land, sea, air, and life, and how these interactions they result in the great variety of landscapesfrom deserts to glaciersthat make our planet unique, and influence climate change in the past and, potentially the future. Finally, we will delve into the processes that produce the energy and mineral resources that modern society depends on, to help understand the context of the environment and sustainability challenges that we will face in the future.

TUDO:This course is a rigorous introduction to classical mechanics, which is the study of forces and motion. How does gravity control the motion of theplanets around the sun or the motion of a projectile fired from a cannon? Why does a spinning skater spin faster whenshe pulls her arms in? Why is aperpetual motion machine impossible? These are the kinds of questions which canbe answered with classical mechanics, which was first formulated by IsaacNewton around 1666. Classical, or Newtonian Mechanics is the oldest branch ofphysics, but it will never go out of style.It remains the foundation of our understanding of the physical world andis constantly used by engineers and scientists. There is a space probe, calledNew Horizons, that is on its way to Pluto right now, and it will arrive on July14, 2015, exactly on time and on target, because its path has been computedusing classical mechanics, and nothingmore.

TUDO:Teachingis isolating. Most of the work happens behind a closed door.Teachers want feedback about their teaching, but encounter threeproblems:1.They don't get much. The principal or department head doesn't visit veryoften. And theres no built-in structure at their school for peerobservation.2.The feedback isn't helpful or actionable.Sometimesit's just happy talk -- 98% of American teachers are rated satisfactory -- andwhile everyone likes a pat on the back, evaluations that say "you werewonderful" don't make better teachers. Or sometimes the feedback iscritical in ways that dont present clear next steps. Sometimes it'svague or just plain wrong.3.Some teachers can be defensive.(Yes,we know  only SOME people are defensive, but not YOU. You are different.You handle feedback with grace, confidence, and a "let's fixthis" orientation. {Exceptsometimes maybe not.})***Thiscourse is based on a simple idea: that teachers take control of their ownimprovement by aggressively seeking out and acting upon feedback about theirteaching.Weall wish that our public school system was such that every teacher would haveeasy access to great coaching  or even any coaching at all. But unfortunately thatsnot the world we live in. Indeed, high school athletes can EXPECT to becoached, but schoolteachers somehow need to track it down themselves. Teachersdeserve better. But they have a choice: bemoanthe lack of legit coaching that they get and will likely continue to get, orbecome the rare teacher who builds her own improvement loop.Wewill review the realities of teacher feedback in typical schools, looking atwhere that feedback usually comes to teachers and how its processed. Inmost schools, the teacher plays a passive role in thiswaiting until anevaluation comes to them. We believe the best teachers create theopposite type of process: they HUNT down feedback, drag it back to their lairs,and use it. They realize that if they wait for good feedback to come tothem, they might wait a long, long time.Weprofile teacherswho'veasked their peers to give them criticalfeedback. How did they ask their colleagues for help? What rubric orobservation protocol did they use? How did they choose what to focus on afterthey got the feedback? What kind of action/improvement plan did the teacherwrite? What happened when the teachers tried to implement their action steps?What did their peers say when they came back to their classroom a few weekslater?Participantsin this course will do the exact same assignment: they will seek out feedbackfrom a peer to generate their own action plan and a reflection on itsimplementation. Participants will also be assigned to give and receive feedbackon these action plans from other students in our MOOC who are working onsimilar focus areas in similar contexts (e.g. other math teachers who aretrying to improve the rigor of their questioning).Firstwe review the emerging new evidence, from the Gates Foundation MET Project,about student surveys and their power for accurately assessing teachersstrengths and weaknesses. Then, similar to the Peer Feedback class, weshow a teacher going through all the steps, interspersed with commentary fromthe course instructor.Again,our MOOC participants will do the same assignment: create a student survey(well show you examples); administer the survey; tabulate the data; write andimplement a plan; and get and give feedback from/to a peer with a similar focusarea.Firstwe cover the evidence of how schools and teachers are using student assessmentdata to drive instructional improvements.

TUDO:Networked Life looks at how our world is connected -- socially, strategically and technologically -- and why it matters.The answers to the questions above are related. They have been the subject of a fascinating intersection of disciplines, including computer science, physics, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics and finance. Researchers from these areas all strive to quantify and explain the growing complexity and connectivity of the world around us, and they have begun to develop a rich new science along the way.Networked Life will explore recent scientific efforts to explain social, economic and technological structures -- and the way these structures interact -- on many different scales, from the behavior of individuals or small groups to that of complex networks such as the Internet and the global economy.This course covers computer science topics and other material that is mathematical, but all material will be presented in a way that is accessible to an educated audience with or without a strong technical background. The majority of the course is grounded in scientific and mathematical findings of the past two decades or less (often much less).Networked Life is the flagship course of the newat the University of Pennsylvania.

TUDO:In the revival of mysticism today, mysticism hasbecome more psychological while psychology is increasingly interested inmysticism. This course will provide an entry into the complex world of modernmysticism, through studying its psychological thought. We shall begin withexploring the interpretations of mystical experience offered by psychoanalystsin the twentieth century, starting with Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung and endingwith contemporary thinkers such as James Hillman. However, we will see that theEuropean mystical traditions, including Kabbalah in the Jewish world and thoseof the Catholic and Protestant worlds, developed their own elaborate systems ofpsychological thought. Thus, we will mostly examine mystical psychology on itsown terms. We shall especially look at two terms that are very much in use alsoin general culture: the heart (as an emotional rather than as a physical center!...)and the soul, looking at the unique mystical concepts of their nature and destinyand asking if there were influences and meetings between the differentreligions.

TUDO:This course is designed to introduce students to basic microeconomic theoryat a relatively rapid pace. The focus will be on fundamental economic principlesthat can be used by managers to think about business problems, includingthose inside the firm (relating to the problem of administering the firmsresources in the most cost-effective way) and those outside the firm (relatingto broader market and government forces that can affect the behavior offirms). The course will not deal directly with standard managerial economics,which tends to emphasize the mathematics and statistical techniques usedin optimizing firm decisions. However, every effort will be made to applybasic principles to management problems, mainlythose relating togetting incentives right for customers, suppliers, workers, managers, andowners. Accordingly, this course will focus on an emerging subdisciplinewithin economics,. It will stress methodsof thinking, and students will be evaluated on their ability to recall,use, and extend the methods of thinking that are covered during the quarter.

TUDO:In this coursewe discuss how to identify causal effect in the social sciences. Causal effectsare interesting whenever we want to understand.Asan example we can think of the case of wage differentials across gender. Thismay be due to either discrimination from employers or differences in unobservedbackground characteristics across gender. Usually we would like to think aboutdiscrimination as a mechanism whereas differences in background characteristicswould usually not been seen as a mechanism. So it may be important to be ableto tell why there is pay differences across gender.During the course we willexamine such research designs and strategies and look at the relevance of different assumptions behind thesemethods. The course also addresses the benefits of experimental data and introduces several new statistical and econometrical methods designed to improve causal statements fromnon-experimental and observational data.

TUDO:Machine learning algorithms can figure out how to perform important tasks by generalizing from examples. This is often feasible and cost-effective when manual programming is not. Machine learning (also known as data mining, pattern recognition and predictive analytics) is used widely in business, industry, science and government, and there is a great shortage of experts in it. If you pick up a machine learning textbook you may find it forbiddingly mathematical, but in this class you will learn that the key ideas and algorithms are in fact quite intuitive. And powerful!Most of the class will be devoted to supervised learning (in other words, learning in which a teacher provides the learner with the correct answers at training time). This is the most mature and widely used type of machine learning. We will cover the main supervised learning techniques, including decision trees, rules, instances, Bayesian techniques, neural networks, model ensembles, and support vector machines. We will also touch on learning theory with an emphasis on its practical uses. Finally, we will cover the two main classes of unsupervised learning methods: clustering and dimensionality reduction. Throughout the class there will be an emphasis not just on individual algorithms but on ideas that cut across them and tips for making them work.In the class projects you will build your own implementations of machine learning algorithms and apply them to problems like spam filtering, clickstream mining, recommender systems, and computational biology. This will get you as close to becoming a machine learning expert as you can in ten weeks!

TUDO:With the click of a mouse, now more than ever we are able to access sounds made by people from all around the world. And yet, most of us don't listen to the wide diversity of music available to us, probably because it sounds so strange. This class will open up the world of music to you. We begin with a brief history of recording technology, the music industry and the place of world music in that narrative; you are introduced to keywords for talking about music cross-culturally; and then proceed to half a dozen musical cultures around the world. In each of these musical cultures, we examine the ways in which music works in those distant cultures, how it sounds, what it means, who may perform it; and then we ask ourselves where this music has traveled and entered into the Western popular culture as entertainment, political discourse, or artistic purpose.

Besides learning how linear and discrete optimization can be applied, we focus on understanding methods that solve linear programs and discrete optimization problems in a mathematically rigorous way.We will answer questions like:The course starts by discussing what a linear program is and how linear programming can be applied. Then, we will treat the simplex method and the theory of duality. We will then discuss some combinatorial optimization problems like maximum weight bipartite matching and maximum flows.The course constitutes about half of the material on linear and discrete optimization that is taught for mathematics and computer science undergraduates at EPFL and will feature video lectures, quizzes, programming assignments, and a final exam.

Nel microscopico si invece abbandonata la descrizione della fisica classica, magari caotica, masempre deterministica, per arrivare ad una descrizione probabilistica, in cuigli stati e le propriet del mondo microscopico non sono determinati, a priori,intrinsecamente, ma acquisiscono realt solo se vengano misurati o se entrinoin contatto con altri oggetti. Labbandono della realt locale, del fattocio che le azioni esercitate in un luogo, per particolari sistemi, possonoavere effetti istantanei su oggetti a distanze virtualmente infinite,stravolgono la descrizione di un mondo che fino al secolo scorso sembravasensato e ragionevole. Nel corso verranno descritte le principalicaratteristiche di queste due teorie, di come abbiano cambiato il concetto delnostro universo e delle possibilit di conoscerlo, e di come abbiano influitonella vita quotidiana.

TUDO:This course surveys the reactions of organic compounds with an emphasis on mechanisms and a structure-based approach to understanding reactivity. Concepts and models are developed to build intuition about the reactivity of organic compounds. These concepts will prepare students for a mechanistic-based approach to learning organic reactivity. Emphasis will also be placed on developing problem-solving skills unique to organic chemistry. This course, orgchem1b, together with its prerequisite, orgchem1a are equivalent to a first-semester organic chemistry course; these courses and the subsequent courses (orgchem2a and orgchem2b) are especially suited for students in agricultural, nutritional and biological sciences, as well as premedical, predental, and preveterinary programs.

TUDO:This course introduces the academic approach of Sustainability and explores how todays human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations. The course focuses on key knowledge areas of sustainability theory and practice, including population, ecosystems, global change, energy, agriculture, water, environmental economics and policy, ethics, and cultural history.This subject is of vital importance, seeking as it does to uncover the principles of the long-term welfare of all the peoples of the planet. As sustainability is a cross-disciplinary field of study, this foundation requires intellectual breadth: as I describe it in the class text, understanding our motivations requires the humanities, measuring the challenges of sustainability requires knowledge of the sciences (both natural and social), and building solutions requires technical insight into systems (such as provided by engineering, planning, and management).

TUDO:We live in a world that is changing very quickly. Sociology gives us the tools to understand our own lives and those quite remote from us. The premise of this class is that in order to benefit from the sociological perspective, we need to learn how to ask certain basic questions. We need to know how to seek answers through methods that strive to be systematic and generalizable.We will begin with some of the essential questions: How are the things that we take to be natural socially constructed? How do we live today? How determined is social life? Does the individual make a difference? How is social order possible? Then we will ask what techniques are available to make sense of these questions. We will review comparative, historical, demographic, experimental, and ethnographic methods. Along the way, we will study core concepts including ethnocentrism, social networks, community, unanticipated consequences, social capital, race, class, and gender.We will strive to understand how interaction in micro-level contexts affects larger social processes and how such macro-level processes influence our day to day lives. We will learn to conceive of inequality by asking how race, class, and gender work in tandem. We will address one of the crises of recent sociology -- whether we can actually isolate the effects of social context. We will think about how social science is changing at a time when we are literally swimming in oceans of data generated by the internet.

TUDO:Each of our cells contains nearly identical copies of our genome, which provides instructions that allow us to develop and function. The field of Genomics focuses on the structure and function of genomes and plays a major and increasing role in both medicine and research. This course serves as an introduction to the main laboratory and theoretical aspects of genomics and is divided into themes: genomes, genetics, functional genomics, systems biology, single cell approaches, proteomics, and applications. We start with the basics, DNA sequencing and the genome project, then move to high throughput sequencing methods and applications. Next we introduce principles of genetics and then apply them in clinical genetics and other large-scale sequencing projects. In the functional genomics unit, we start with RNA expression dynamics, analysis of alternative splicing, epigenomics and ChIP-seq, and metagenomics. Model organisms and forward and reverse genetics screens are then discussed, along with quantitative trait locus (QTL) and eQTL analysis. After that, we introduce integrative and single cell genomics approaches and systems biology. Finally, we conclude by introducing in applying proteomic approaches.

TUDO:Students in this class will learn modeling and analysis techniques applicable to electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems. This systems view, that focuses on what is common to these different physical systems, has been responsible for much of the progress in the last several decades in aeronautics, robotics, and other engineering disciplines where there are many different technologies working together.Starting with algebraic descriptions of individual components (such as resistors), the class develops tools capable of predicting large-scale behavior of dynamic systems that evolve over time. Differential equations are key ingredients, so we will spend significant time learning how to derive differential equations from component descriptions. One of the key ideas in this class is that electrical, mechanical, and chemical systems may seem very different from each other but often have very similar behavior, allowing us to draw powerful analogies between them. Case studies from several areas of engineering will be used to illustrate the modeling techniques, including examples from robotics, power networks, drug delivery, vehicle suspension, thermal stress, and flexible electronics. Students will have the option of doing hands on experiments that demonstrate the utility of the techniques.

TUDO:E-learning and Digital Cultures isaimed at teachers, learning technologists, and people with a general interestin education who want to deepen their understanding of what it means to teachand learn in the digital age. The course is about how digital culturesintersect with learning cultures online, and how our ideas about onlineeducation are shaped through narratives, or big stories, about therelationship between people and technology. Well explore some of the mostengaging perspectives on digital culture in its popular and academic forms, andwell consider how our practices as teachers and learners are informed by thedifference of the digital. Well look at how learning and literacy isrepresented in popular digital-, (or cyber-) culture, and explore how thatconnects with the visions and initiatives we are seeing unfold in ourapproaches to digital education.This course will not be taught via aseries of video lectures. Rather, a selection of rich resources will be providedthrough which you can begin to engage with the themes of the course. While theteachers will be present in the discussion forums and in various other mediaenvironments, there will be an emphasis on learner-led group formation, and theuse of social media to build personal learning networks and communities ofpeers.

TUDO:The goal of the course is to develop a complete working set of digital signal processing notions from the ground up. DSP is arguably at the heart of the digital revolution that, in the space of just a few decades, has enabled unprecedented levels of interpersonal communication and of information availability.In the class, starting from the basic definitions of a discrete-time signal, we will work our way through Fourier analysis, filter design, sampling, interpolation and quantization to build a DSP toolset complete enough to analyze a practical communication system in detail. Hands-on examples and demonstration will be routinely used to close the gap between theory and practice.

TUDO:Obesity is a common disorder, and in the UnitedStates and many other western countries more than half of the populations areoverweight or obese. The prevalence is increasing dramatically, and the numberof obese individuals worldwide is now projected to reach as much as 1.1 billionby 2030. Along with the increasing numbers of obese people, the prevalence oftype-2 diabetes is increasing tremendously worldwide due to the westernizedlifestyle. However, the sensitivity of the individual to a westernizedlifestyle and development of diabetes appears to be much dependent on his orher genetic risk factors.As diabetes isassociated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, and thereby accountsfor a large part of the public health care expenses, there is a great interestin diabetes research to improve knowledge, prevention and treatment of diabetes.This diabetes course will give you the newest state of the art updates on diabetes research in the fields of clinical aspects of diabetes and regulation of insulinsecretion, epidemiology of diabetes, heritability of diabetes, genetic aspectsof diabetes, prevention of diabetes and insulin resistance, molecular insulinresistance, cellular aspects of diabetes, physiological regulation of bloodglucose, type 1 diabetes and stem cell research in diabetes.Each section will be coveredby world leading professors (to be announced) in the specific areas.

TUDO:You have probably heard that this is the era of Big Data. Stories about    companies or scientists using data to recommend movies, discover who is    pregnant based on credit card receipts, or confirm the existence of the    Higgs Boson regularly appear in Forbes, the Economist, the Wall Street    Journal, and The New York Times. But how does one turn data into this type    of insight? The answer is data analysis and applied statistics. Data analysis    is the process of finding the right data to answer your question, understanding    the processes underlying the data, discovering the important patterns in    the data, and then communicating your results to have the biggest possible    impact. There is a critical shortage of people with these skills in the    workforce, which is why Hal Varian (Chief Economist at Google) says that    being a statistician will be the sexy job for the next 10 years.This course is an applied statistics course focusing on data analysis.    The course will begin with an overview of how to organize, perform, and    write-up data analyses. Then we will cover some of the most popular and    widely used statistical methods like linear regression, principal components    analysis, cross-validation, and p-values. Instead of focusing on mathematical    details, the lectures will be designed to help you apply these techniques    to real data using the R statistical programming language, interpret the    results, and diagnose potential problems in your analysis. You will also    have the opportunity to critique and assist your fellow classmates with    their data analyses.

TUDO:Critical thinking is the ability to gather and assess information and evidence in a balanced and reflective way to reach conclusions that are justified by reasoned argument based on the available evidence. Critical thinking is a key skill in the information age, valuable in all disciplines and professions.This introductory course will give you the opportunity to better understand what critical thinking is, and to practice and enhance your critical thinking skills. To do so, we will use the context of some important global challenges that affect us all, and to which we have no clear correct solutions: for example, the risk and spread of serious infectious diseases in epidemics in modern societies, the implications of increasing human population on global resources, energy, environment and climate, and the challenges of human health and wellbeing in the modern world. Possible solutions to global issues such as these are hotly debated, and give the perfect setting to practice recognizing and evaluating facts, ideas, opinions and arguments.The relevant background information for each global challenge will be provided to ensure that you can complete the exercises. Note, however, this course is not a course on these global challenges themselves; instead it uses the context of these thought-provoking challenges to practice critical thinking.

TUDO:Why Content Strategy is essential for professionals in any organizationbusiness,non-profit, or government.Content Strategy is a conversation that provides thought-leadership. Itstarts a conversation with users and stakeholders inside and outsidean organization. Conversations are the natural way people think aboutcomplex issues. Conversations also enable people to develop stories,which lead to understanding and helpful mental pictures. Content Strategypractitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises  in all departmentsand sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks.In this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know thatif they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond theirjob descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that isvalued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make theirenterprise stand out.Regardless of their department, area of work, or expertise, Content Strategypractitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobilemedia to interact with their most important constituents with trustable,actionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategiccontent they produce enhances the audiences lives anddeepens theirunderstanding and engagement with the organization.Content Strategy is similar to the best examples of journalism, but itis done by non-journalism organizations. Content Strategy is always honest,trustable, and transparent. It tells all sides of every story it reports.Often it is also deeper and directed at topics and audiences that traditionaljournalism under-serves or does not reach at all. Content Strategy is notadvertising, marketing, or public relations. It is different because itnever pursues the persuasive goals that are appropriate in those disciplines.

TUDO:Computer vision seeks to develop algorithms that replicate one of the most amazing capabilities of the human brain - inferring properties of the external world purely by means of the light reflected from various objects to the eyes. We can determine how far away these objects are, how they are oriented with respect to us, and in relationship to various other objects. We reliably guess their colors and textures, and we can recognize them - this is a chair, this is my dog Fido, this is a picture of Bill Clinton smiling. We can segment out regions of space corresponding to particular objects and track them over time, such as a basketball player weaving through the court.In this course, we will study the concepts and algorithms behind some of the remarkable successes of computer vision - capabilities such as face detection, handwritten digit recognition, reconstructing three-dimensional models of cities, automated monitoring of activities, segmenting out organs or tissues in biological images, and sensing for control of robots. We will build this up from fundamentals - an understanding of the geometry and radiometry of image formation, core image processing operations, as well as tools from statistical machine learning. On completing this course a student would understand the key ideas behind the leading techniques for the main problems of computer vision - reconstruction, recognition and segmentation - and have a sense of what computers today can or cannot do.

TUDO:When a 3-dimensional world is projected onto a 2-dimensional image, such as the human retina or a photograph, reconstructing back the layout and contents of the real-world becomes an ill-posed problem that is extremely difficult to solve. Humans possess the remarkable ability to navigate and understand the visual world by solving the inversion problem going from 2D to 3D. Computer Vision, a modern discipline of artificial intelligence, seeks to imitate such abilities of humans to recognize objects, navigate scenes, reconstruct layouts, and understand the geometric space and semantic meaning of the visual world. These abilities are critical in many applications including personal robotics, autonomous driving and exploration as well as photo organization, image or video retrieval and human-computer interaction.This course delivers a systematic overview of computer vision, comparable to an advanced graduate level class. We emphasize on two key issues in modeling vision: space and meaning. We begin by laying out the main problems vision needs to solve: mapping out the 3D structure of objects and scenes, recognizing objects, segmenting objects, recognizing meaning of scenes, understanding movements of humans, etc. Motivated by these important problems centered on the understanding of space and meaning, we will study the fundamental theories and important algorithms of computer vision together, starting from the analysis of 2D images, and culminating in the holistic understanding of a 3D scene

TUDO:The Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM) offer the opportunity for educators to transform teaching and learning by positioning students in more active roles as learners. In addition to explicit content standards (which describe what students will know), the CCSSM present a broad range of practice standards that describe ways that successful students in math demonstrate proficiency. What do students and teachers need to know to take on these standards? What does it mean, for example, for students to persevere through new and challenging problems, and/or critique the reasoning of other students, and how can their teachers best support them?In the words of one math teacher, its not the students job to figure out what is in our heads; its the teachers job to figure out what is in theirs. Such an approach requires far more focus on formative assessment and deliberate strategies for teachers to pre-assess students assets, needs, and misconceptions  then move them forward while continually re-assessing.

TUDO:Clinical problem solving or diagnostic reasoning is the skill that physicians use to understand a patients complaints and then to identify a short, prioritized list of possible diagnoses that could account for those complaints. This differential diagnosis then drives the choice of diagnostic tests and possible treatments. Despite striking advances in information technology, clinical problem solving has not yet been effectively replicated by computers, making it essential that clinicians work to develop expertise in this very important skill set. While television shows make this seem like a magical process, work done by cognitive psychologists and medical educators has helped us understand the ways in which expert physicians reason through these difficult problems to help their patients.This course will examine the ways physicians think about clinical problem solving and will help participants develop competence in the building blocks of clinical problem solving. The professor will use cases to illustrate different reasoning strategies and will discuss how both correct and incorrect diagnoses result from these strategies. Participants will use sample clinical cases to practice what they have learned through the lectures. Finally, the professor will discuss strategies to help students and young physicians read textbooks and articles in a way that enhances their ability to use information in the clinical environment.

TUDO:Over two thousand years ago, the ancient Greeks wondered if other worlds were habitable. In the coming years this question will be experimentally tested. This course, offered by the UK Centre for Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh,is an introduction to astrobiology. It explores the origin and evolution of life on the Earth and its potential to exist elsewhere. Astrobiology addresses compelling questions of wide interest such as: How did life originate on the Earth? Is this an inevitable process and is life common across the Universe? Astrobiology is an interdisciplinary science that bridges fields as diverse as astrophysics, biology, geosciences and chemistry.In this course we will explore what we know about lifes ability to live in extreme environments on the Earth, we will look at different hypotheses for how it originated. We will look at some of the missions to search for life in our own Solar System and on planets orbiting distant stars. We will discuss some of the extreme environments on the Earth that help us understand the limits of life and how life has adapted to cope with extremes. We will explore the possibility of intelligent alien life and some of the implications of its detection. The course will provide a foundation in astrobiology and introduce students to concepts in a diversity of scientific fields.

TUDO:In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of advanced algorithm design. You'll learn the greedy algorithm design paradigm, with applications to computing good network backbones (i.e., spanning trees) and good codes for data compression. You'll learn the tricky yet widely applicable dynamic programming algorithm design paradigm, with applications to routing in the Internet and sequencing genome fragments. Youll learn what NP-completeness and the famous P vs. NP problem mean for the algorithm designer. Finally, well study several strategies for dealing with hard (i.e., NP-complete problems), including the design and analysis of heuristics. Learn how shortest-path algorithms from the 1950s (i.e., pre-ARPANET!) govern the way that your Internet traffic gets routed today; why efficient algorithms are fundamental to modern genomics; and how to make a million bucks in prize money by just solving a math problem!

TUDO:Uncertainty is unavoidable in real-world applications: we can almost never predict with certainty what will happen in the future, and even in the present and the past, many important aspects of the world are not observed with certainty. Probability theory gives us the basic foundation to model our beliefs about the different possible states of the world, and to update these beliefs as new evidence is obtained. These beliefs can be combined with individual preferences to help guide our actions, and even in selecting which observations to make. While probability theory has existed since the 17th century, our ability to use it effectively on large problems involving many inter-related variables is fairly recent, and is due largely to the development of a framework known as Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This framework, which spans methods such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, uses ideas from discrete data structures in computer science to efficiently encode and manipulate probability distributions over high-dimensional spaces, often involving hundreds or even many thousands of variables. These methods have been used in an enormous range of application domains, which include: web search, medical and fault diagnosis, image understanding, reconstruction of biological networks, speech recognition, natural language processing, decoding of messages sent over a noisy communication channel, robot navigation, and many more. The PGM framework provides an essential tool for anyone who wants to learn how to reason coherently from limited and noisy observations.

TUDO:Medical Neuroscience explores the organization and physiology of the human central nervous system. This course is designed for first-year students in graduate-level health professions programs. It builds upon knowledge acquired in prior studies of cellular and molecular biology, general physiology, and human anatomy. The course provides students an understanding of the essential principles of neurological function, from cellular and molecular mechanisms of neural signaling and plasticity to the organization and function of sensory and motor systems. This course emphasizes the neural and vascular anatomy of the human brain and spinal cord, providing an anatomical framework for localizing lesions within the central nervous system. It also emphasizes the neurobiological foundation for understanding mental illness and disorders of human behavior.The overall goal is to equip students in the health professions for interpreting impairments of sensation, action and cognition that accompany neurological injury, disease or dysfunction. Students currently pursuing advanced studies in the brain sciences will benefit from this course by learning the fundamentals of functional human neuroanatomy and how neuroscience discovery translates to clinical practice.

In particular, the course will cover methods of data collection, constructing effective graphical and numerical displays to understand the data, how to estimate and describe the error in estimates of some important quantities, and the key ideas in how statistical tests can be used to separate significant differences from those that are only a reflection of the natural variability in data.

TUDO:Social networks pervade our social and economic lives.  They play a central role in the transmission of information about job opportunities and are critical to the trade of many goods and services. They are important in determining which products we buy, which languages we speak, how we vote, as well as whether or not we decide to become criminals, how much education we obtain, and our likelihood of succeeding professionally.  The countless ways in which network structures affect our well-being make it critical to understand how social network structures impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do. This course provides an overview and synthesis of research on social and economic networks, drawing on studies by sociologists, economists, computer scientists, physicists, and mathematicians.The course begins with some empirical background onsocial and economic networks, and an overview of concepts used todescribe and measure networks.  Next, we will cover a set ofmodels of how networks form, including random network models as well asstrategic formation models, and some hybrids.  We will then discuss a series ofmodels of how networks impact behavior, including contagion, diffusion, learning, and peer influences.

TUDO:Logic is one of the oldest intellectual disciplines in human history.    It dates back to the times of Aristotle; it has been studied through the    centuries; and it is still a subject of active investigation today.This course is a basic introduction to Logic. It shows how to formalize    information in form of logical sentences. It shows how to reason systematically    with this information to produce all logical conclusions and only logical    conclusions. And it examines logic technology and its applications - in    mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.The course differs from other introductory courses in Logic in two important    ways. First of all, it teaches a novel theory of logic that improves accessibility    while preserving rigor. Second, the material is laced with interactive    demonstrations and exercises that suggest the many practical applications    of the field.

TUDO:Gamification is the application of digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such as business and social impact challenges. Video games are the dominant entertainment form of our time because they are powerful tools for motivating behavior. Effective games leverage both psychology and technology, in ways that can be applied outside the immersive environments of games themselves. Gamification as a business practice has exploded over the past two years. Organizations are applying it in areas such as marketing, human resources, productivity enhancement, sustainability, training, health and wellness, innovation, and customer engagement. Game thinking means more than just dropping in badges and leaderboards; it requires a thoughtful understanding of motivation and design techniques. This course examines the mechanisms of gamification and provides an understanding of its effective use.

TUDO:Probably the greatest challenge of the 21st century of the brain is    to understand how subcellular and cellular neuronal processes give rise    to behavior  movement, perception, emotions, memory and creativity. This    course will discuss, step-by-step, how modern molecular, optical, electrical,    anatomical and theoretical methods have provided fascinating insights into    the operation of the elementary building blocks of brains and, most importantly,    how neuronal mechanisms underlie memory and learning processes. We will    next discuss why computer simulations are so essential for understanding    both neuronal life ware and the emergence of networks dynamics (e.g.,    as in the Blue Brain Project).The course will start by highlighting a few recent brain-excitements,    including treating the sick brain via electrical stimulation, recent attempts    at reading the brain code for brain-machine interfaces, new neuro-anatomical    techniques (Brainbow and connectomics) and physiological methods (optogenetics)    that enables us to record/activate the living, behaving brain at single    cell resolution. We will end by discussing emerging frontiers in brain    research, including the interaction between brain research and the arts.    As an added bonus, a lecture on perception, action, cognition and emotions    will be taught by an acclaimed neuroscientists, Prof. Israel Nelken..

TUDO:In this course,we will examine the main bodies of economic theory that have been used to guideeconomists and policy makers understanding of the macroeconomy. Macroeconomicsis a word derived from the Greek prefix makros, meaning large. It is the studyof economic aggregates, of national and international economies and of theeconomic management role played by governments and international organisations.The founder ofmodern macroeconomics, the British economist John Maynard Keynes, famously wroteThe ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are rightand when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed,the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to bequite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of somedefunct economist. This will be the key theme we explore in the course, theinfluence of theory and the way that policy responses to events like recession,unemployment, inflation and the Global Financial Crisis, reflect that theory.We will coverimportant macroeconomic concepts such as the national accounts, unemploymentand inflation, explain how the ideas associated with John Maynard Keynes laidthe foundation for governments active management of the macroeconomy in thepost war era, and examine the intellectual basis for the monetary and fiscalpolicy responses to the Global Financial Crisis. Economists approaches to the analysis oflong run economic growth will also be considered. The approach will becritical. There are few areas of human endeavour that attract so much debateand disagreement as the management of a modern industrial economy. We will notshy away from those debates. But what we will do is emphasise the systematictheorising that underlies the way macroeconomists and policy makers approachtheir task. The aim is to enable those who take the course to become informedanalysts of the macroeconomy and of current (and past) macroeconomic policydebates.

TUDO:In this course, you will learn how to design technologies that bring peoplejoy, rather than frustration. You'll learn several techniques for rapidlyprototyping and evaluating multiple interface alternatives -- and why rapidprototyping and comparative evaluation are essential to excellent interactiondesign. You'll learn how to conduct fieldwork with people to help you getdesign ideas. How to make paper prototypes and low-fidelity mock-ups thatare interactive -- and how to use these designs to get feedback from otherstakeholders like your teammates, clients, and users. You'll learn principlesof visual design so that you can effectively organize and present informationwith your interfaces. You'll learn principles of perception and cognitionthat inform effective interaction design. And you'll learn how to performand analyze controlled experiments online. In many cases, we'll use Webdesign as the anchoring domain. A lot of the examples will come from theWeb, and we'll talk just a bit about Web technologies in particular. Whenwe do so, it will be to support the main goal of this course, which ishelping you build human-centered design skills, so that you have the principlesand methods to create excellent interfaces with any technology.

TUDO:The purpose of this course is to help individuals and organizationssurvive when confronted with disruptive technologies that threaten theircurrent way of life. We will look at ageneral model of survival and use it to analyze companies and industries thathave failed or are close to failing. Examplesof companies that have not survived include Kodak, a firm over 100 years old,Blockbuster and Borders. It is likelythat each of us has done business with all of these firms, and today Kodak andBlockbuster are in bankruptcy and Borders has been liquidated. Disruptions are impacting industries likeeducation; Coursera and others offering these massive open online courses are achallenge for Universities. In additionto firms that have failed, we will look at some that have survived and aredoing well. What are their strategiesfor survival?By highlighting the reasons for the decline of firms andindustries, participants can begin to understand how to keep the same thingfrom happening to them. Through thestudy of successful organizations, we will try to tease out approaches todisruptions that actually work. Ourultimate objective is to develop a strategy for survival in a world confrontingone disruptive technology after another.

Well show you an approach that helps to break down problems into smaller tasks that are easier to both solve and read.This design approach also makes it more straightforward to find and fix flaws. You'll be introduced to the tools that professional programmers use; they're called "testing" and "debugging".For most complex problems, there are many programs that solve them. Some are inherently slower than others. You'll learn how to read two programs and compare them for efficiency.

TUDO:The American health care system has many problems. 50 million people are uninsured. Quality is extremely uneven, with peaks of greatness at leading academic centers but overall poor quality in both process measures and outcomes such as asthma deaths. Finally, the U.S. health care system spends over $8000 per patient per year, nearly double the next highest country. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Over the next decade or more, the Act will dramatically re-structure the American health care system.This course will explore the history and structure of the current American health care system, including the history of and problems with employment-based health insurance, the challenges surrounding access, cost and quality, and the medical malpractice conundrum. The course will then explore the history of health care reform and the challenges that were overcome to achieve health reform in America. Finally, we will delineate the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act improves access and quality, and will control costs. Throughout lessons regarding health economics, health policy, and medical practice will be elucidated.This class is open to anyone that is interested in gaining a better understanding of the US health care system and the challenges of health care reform. There are no prerequisites or required knowledge of the health system.

TUDO:This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code thats safe, concise, and elegant. Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for todays and tomorrows multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions.Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Klout.In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically.The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, most of which are also programming projects.

TUDO:Quantumphysics is the foundation for much of modern technology, provides the frameworkfor understanding light and matter from the subatomic to macroscopic domains,and makes possible the most precise measurements ever made. More than just a theory, it offers a way oflooking at the world that grows richer with experience and practice. Our course will provide some of that practice and teach you "tricks of the trade" (not found in textbooks) that will enable you to solve quantum-mechanical problems yourself and understand the subject at a deeper level.Thebasic principles of quantum physics are actually quite simple, but they lead toastonishing outcomes. Two examples thatwe will look at from various perspectives are the prediction of the laser byAlbert Einstein in 1917 and the prediction of antimatter by Paul Dirac in 1928. Both of these predictions came from verysimple arguments in quantum theory, and led to results that transformed scienceand society. Another familiarphenomenon, magnetism, had been known since antiquity, but only with the adventof quantum physics was it understood how magnets worked, to a degree that madepossible the discovery in the 1980s of ultrastrong rare-earth magnets. However, lasers, antimatter and magnets areareas of vibrant research, and they are all encountered in the new field ofultracold atomic physics that will provide much of the material of ExploringQuantum Physics.RichardFeynman once said, I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantummechanics. We say, thats no reason notto try! What Feynman was referring to are some of the spooky phenomena like quantum entanglement, which are incomprehensible from the standpoint of classical physics. Even though they have been thoroughly tested by experiment, and are even being exploited for applications such as cryptography and logic processing, they still seem so counterintuitive that they give rise to extraordinary ideas such as the many-world theory. Quantum physics combinesa spectacular record of discovery and predictive success, with foundationalperplexities so severe that even Albert Einstein came to believe that it waswrong. This is what makes it such anexciting area of science!

TUDO:Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course explains the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two or more parties generate a shared secret key. We will cover the relevant number theory and discuss public-key encryption and basic key-exchange.Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.The course will include written homeworks and programming labs. The course is self-contained, however it will be helpful to have a basic understanding of discrete probability theory.

This course will be based heavily on my own research. We will examine topics such as how emotion rather than cognition determines economic decisions, irrational patterns of thinking about money and investments, how expectations shape perceptions, economic and psychological analyses of dishonesty by presumably honest people, and how social and financial incentives combine to motivate labor by everyday workers and CEOs alike. This highly interdisciplinary course will be relevant to all human beings.This class has two main goals:

Along withstudying the most important events and personalities, we will considerbroader issues such as political and cultural values and methods of historicalinterpretation.Some of the topics we will cover include: relations between the Greeksand their neighbors to the East; Homer and the heroic ideal; the developmentof the type of community called the "polis"; the diffusion of Greek civilizationfrom Southern Italy to the shores of the Black Sea; gods and mortals inmyth, religion and ritual; the roles of women; Athenian drama; the treatmentof slaves and foreigners; and the birth and evolution of democracy. Wewill strive to get as full an understanding as we can of this extraordinary,and extraordinarily influential, society.Almost all the reading assignments are from ancient sources in translation.No previous knowledge of ancient history is assumed.

TUDO:One of the most interestingand important developments in social science since 1970 has been the"discovery" of a consistent economic logic underlying the greatcommon law subjects of property, contract, tort and crime, thethousand-year-old bedrock of the English and American legal systems. Propertyand contract provide the institutionalscaffolding that makes free exchange in markets possible, while the liabilitysystems of tort and crime appear tomimic market exchange in areas of human activitywhere free exchange itself, for well-defined reasons, is not possible. Thiscourse seeks to expose this underlying economic logic through the closeinvestigation of a series of paradigmatic problems and examples in light ofsome simple but very powerful economic ideas. The course assumes no priorbackground in economics or law, and begins with an introduction to the basicconcepts of property, exchange, efficiency and externality. On this foundation,specific topics in the law, including property, tortand crime, eminent domain, intellectual property and criminal procedure,are considered. Each group of lectures willelaborate on a different concrete problem or example to suggest the range of legal issues and questionsto which economic reasoning can be productively applied. The ideas andmodes of analysis developed in the course are not difficult or mysterious, butthe questions of interpretation and policy that they raise about a subjectthat affects everyoneare challenging andprovocative.

TUDO:Thiscourse examines the U.S. civil rights movement from the vantage point of women,considering both womens involvement in the legal campaigns and politicalprotests and the impact of civil rights struggles on womens status andidentity. Taking a long civil rightsmovement perspective, we begin in the late nineteenth century and considerevents, organizations, and personalities through the twentieth century.Throughoutwe will consider issues which have preoccupied historians, social movementtheorists, and historians alike:developing and sustaining political commitment, assessing the strengthsand weaknesses of various forms of political organization, maximizing influenceand securing long-range objectives. Wewill also examine competing definitions of leadership; class, race, and genderdynamics within the movement; and the cultural dynamics of political organizingand social change.In the process, weconsider not only how the movement altered the status of African Americans inthe U.S. but the legacy of these struggles as they changed understandings ofcitizenship and rights more broadly. Our concern throughout the course will be tonot only understand the historical narrative but also to see how historianswork to make sense of the past.

TUDO:Energy 101 focuses on the big energy picture giving perspective and context to the details one reads in the daily onslaught of energy news in the headlines. As the number 101 indicates, there are no pre-requisites and no particular training or background needed. The course will review the driving forces of energy used in transportation, building heating and cooling, electrical loads and manufacturing. The current facts and trends of the resulting demands placed on coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, biomass, solar and wind used to meet these energy demands are then covered. The technologies and characteristics of different energy processes and infrastructure used to convert the renewable, fossil, and nuclear energy into the desired form necessary to accomplish a given task are then described. Economics is always a part of the discussion. The natural laws of thermodynamics limiting these processes are described, as well as future technologies and their potential.

TUDO:This course investigates how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, and predictable ways. The basic tool for achieving this is "control theory", which deals with the question of how dynamical systems, i.e., systems whose behaviors change over time, can be effectively influenced. In the course, these two domains - controls and robotics - will be interleaved and we will go from the basics of control theory, via robotic examples of increasing complexity - all the way to the research frontier. The course will focus on mobile robots as the target application and problems that will be covered include (1) how to make (teams of) wheeled ground robots avoid collisions while reaching target locations, (2) how to make aerial, quadrotor robots follow paths in the presence of severe disturbances, and (3) how to locomotive bipedal, humanoid robots.

TUDO:This is a survey course in modern world history forstudents, beginning or advanced, who wish to better understand how the worldgot to be the way it is today. In order to understand modern history, a globalperspective is essential. This is true whether you are interested in economics,warfare, philosophy, politics, or even pop culture. This course can thereforebe essential for students in many fields, a base equipping them with tools forlifelong learning.In its current form, the course on Coursera is not offeredfor college credit. But it is a vital part of the for credit course on thistopic being offered at the University of Virginia in the spring semester of2013. Both the Coursera and the UVA students will use the same online material asa common foundation for their different learning experiences. This is the material to survey 'whathappened' and the big questions about how to explain so many changes  some ofthose questions that start with:"Why?" (The students inthe UVA course then supplement this online material with a lot of additionalreading, research projects about the histories of particular communities aroundthe world, in-person tutorials and discussions both with me and with theirgraduate teaching assistants, and examinations.)It is tempting to think that if we can just understand thebig patterns, we don't have to get too caught up in the details. In thiscourse, though, we care about chronology. We care about individuals. Without somecareful attention to sequences of cause and effect, without tracing how bigchanges come from the choices made by particular people, history can turn intojust a series of descriptions, a somewhat tiresome recitation of one thingafter another. Not this course. So a big part of what we will do is not onlyoffer a set of remarkable stories, but also offer you training in how toanalyze a situation andhow to think about problems of explaining change.

TUDO:What is image and video processing? Images and videos are everywhere, from those we take with our mobile devices and share with our friends to those that we receive from Mars and the ones we see in the movie theatre, without forgetting the whole ensemble of images of our bodies that are taken in hospital visits. Image and video processing is the art of working with such images and movies, from making it possible to store and transmit them to making those dark and blurry images look nice, as well as interpreting and analyzing the medical data and recognizing our friends faces in social pictures. This discipline is also fascinating because it uses tools from many areas of applied mathematics. In this class you will look behind the scenes of image and video processing, from the basic and classical tools to the most modern and advanced algorithms.The course will start with an introduction to the basics of image formation and the fundamental concepts that translate a physical scene into a digital image. We will then describe the underlying concepts of image compression, the enabling technology that makes it possible for images to be sent from Mars and videos to be stored in our mobile phones. We will cover the most fundamental tools in image enhancement, showing how simple tools can significantly improve images. Both geometric and non-geometric tools as well as spatial and non-spatial operations will be presented. Details on image segmentation will be provided, one of the most fundamental and useful problems in image processing. The above topics will be extended to color images and video. Once we have covered the fundamentals, which both provide the basis for modern image and video processing and serve many important applications until today, we will move into recent progress in the area, covering image inpainting (how to remove objects from images and video), image processing via sparse modeling and compressed sensing, geometric partial differential equations for image analysis, image processing for HIV and virus research, and image processing for neurosurgery and other medical applications.

TUDO:The impact of economic forces in our lives is sizable and pervasive. For this reason, it is impossible to understand the social and economic forces shaping our lives without a good understanding of basic economic principles. This course provides a quantitative and model-based introduction to such principles, and teaches how to apply them to make sense of a wide range of real world problems. Examples of applications include predicting the impact of technological changes in market prices, calculating the optimal gasoline tax, and measuring the value of new products.This is a real Caltech class. It will be taught concurrently to Caltech and on-line students. This has two implications. On the costs side: the class is challenging, highly quantitative, and will demand significant effort. On the benefit side: successful completion of the class will provide you with an in-depth understanding of basic economics, and will permanently change the way you see the world.

TUDO:Popularized by movies such as "A Beautiful Mind", game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what we call 'games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model eBay, Google keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more. We'll include a variety of examples including classic games and real-world applications.

In the first four weeks, we will review principles of effective writing, examples of good and bad writing, and tips for making the writing process easier. In the second four weeks, we will examine issues specific to scientific writing, including: authorship, peer review, the format of an original manuscript, and communicating science for lay audiences. Students will complete editing exercises, write two short papers, and edit each others work.The primary audience is undergraduate science majors, graduate students in scientific disciplines, and professional scientists. Students from non-science disciplines can also benefit from the training provided in the first four weeks (on general principles of effective writing).

TUDO:It is hard to imagine living in modern society without participating in or interacting with organizations. The ubiquity and variability of organizations means there is ample room for complexity and confusion in the organizational challenges we regularly face. Through this course, students will consider cases describing various organizational struggles: school systems and politicians attempting to implement education reforms; government administrators dealing with an international crisis; technology firms trying to create a company ethos that sustains worker commitment; and even two universities trying to gain international standing by performing a merger.Each case is full of details and complexity. So how do we make sense of organizations and the challenges they face, let alone develop means of managing them in desired directions? While every detail can matter, some matter more than others. This is why we rely on organizational theories -- to focus our attention and draw out relevant features in a sensible way.Through this course you will come to see that there is nothing more practical than a good theory. Every week, youll learn a different organizational theory, and it will become a lens through which you can interpret concrete organizational situations. Armed with a toolset of theories, you will then be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it  and use the theories to predict which actions will best redirect the organization in a desired direction.

Phrase:   Through this course, students will consider cases describing various organizational struggles: school systems and politicians attempting to implement education reforms; government administrators dealing with an international crisis; technology firms trying to create a company ethos that sustains worker commitment; and even two universities trying to gain international standing by performing a merger
Phrase:  Each case is full of details and complexity
Phrase:   So how do we make sense of organizations and the challenges they face, let alone develop means of managing them in desired directions? While every detail can matter, some matter more than others
Phrase:   This is why we rely on organizational theories -- to focus our attention and draw out relevant features in a sensible way
Phrase:  Through this course you will come to see that there is nothing more practical than a good theory
Phrase:   Every week, youll learn a different organizational theory, and it will become a lens through which you can interpret concrete organizational situations
Phrase:   Armed with a toolset of theories, you will then be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it  and use the theories to predict which actions will best redirect the organization in a desired direction
Phrase:  
verbo:use/use

TUDO:A computer program is a set of instructions for a computer to follow, just as a recipe is a set of instructions for a chef. Laptops, kitchen appliances, MP3 players, and many other electronic devices all run computer programs. Programs have been written to manipulate sound and video, write poetry, run banking systems, predict the weather, and analyze athletic performance. This course is intended for people who have never seen a computer program. It will give you a better understanding of how computer applications work and teach you how to write your own applications. More importantly, youll start to learn computational thinking, which is a fundamental approach to solving real-world problems. Computer programming languages share common fundamental concepts, and this course will introduce you to those concepts using the Python programming language. By the end of this course, you will be able to write your own programs to process data from the web and create interactive text-based games.

TUDO:This course provides students with a short overview of structure and content of the Universe. Each week will cover one question. In week one we address the issue of extra-solar planets - planets orbiting other stars and ask what do we know about these alien worlds touching on issues of life in the Universe as well. In the second week we explore the life of stars. The third week looks at galaxies their history and their distribution across space. The last two lectures explore cosmology - the history of the Universe as a whole.Each lecture will use online interactives developed for the textbook that will help students gain an understanding of the dynamic nature of the topic. By the end of the class students will have gained an overview of the Universe they inhabit and an understanding of its biggest unresolved questions.

TUDO:Our overarching goal is to support participants in developing the knowledge    and skills needed to take up student thinking in ways that enable all students    to learn challenging subject matter  a practice we call leveraging student    thinking.Course content will focus primarily on middle grades classrooms in various    disciplines, but the practice of leveraging student thinking is applicable    to ALL subject areas and grade levels. Participants will explore the design    of curricular tasks, the analysis of patterns of talk, and the use of representational    tools to:These ideas will be introduced through guided engagement with video cases.    Analysis of the video cases will highlight the elements involved in leveraging    student thinking, and also will illustrate the epistemic, academic, developmental    and managerial pressure points that challenge teachers ability to capitalize    on student thinking in constructive ways.Throughout the course, participants will further explore and test out these ideas in their own classrooms,be they formal or informal. (A Sunday school class, a scout troop, a homeschool opportunity, or a traditional classroom environment would all be appropriate, but some kind of teaching practice is necessary to benefit from the course.) The goal is towork on the work of teachingteaching.In addition, critical reflection with a group of partners is an important component of this course. Atkeypoints, participants will be asked to document their work to share with peers for feedback.Therefore, we strongly encourage teachers toplan on working throughthis course in teams (of two to four people) to facilitate mutual observation, analysis and discussion. Teacherswhodo not have a team at the beginning of the coursewill be able to create a team throughonline forums at the beginning of the courseand can exchange their teaching examples through video or narrative descriptions.

TUDO:This course covers our evolutionary history across more than seven million years, from our origins among the apes up to the biological changes that are still unfolding today. If you enroll, you'll encounter the evidence for the earliest members of our lineage, as they begin the long pathway to humanity. You'll see how scientists are learning about the diets of ancient people, using microscopic evidence and chemical signatures in ancient teeth. We will explore together the exciting fossil discoveries of the last ten years, which have shaken up our notions of the origin of human culture and our own genus.Genomics has fundamentally transformed the way we understand our evolution, in many ways opening the direct evidence of our history to anyone. The course will teach you how to look inside the genomes of humans, Neandertals and other ancient people.If you have used personal genomics to get your own genotypes, the course will guide you in connectinggeneticsto your ancestry among ancient humans.The course brings a special focus on the rapid evolutionary changes of the last 10,000 years. You'll learn about the consequences of our shift to agriculture, and the ways that people of industrialized nations are still changing today.At the end, we trek forward to anticipate what evolutionary changes may be in store for humanity in the future, using our knowledge of history and scientific understanding to inform our speculations.

TUDO:Universities, and higher education systems worldwide, are being transformed    by new or changing practices, programs, policies, and agendas. From notions    of global competency and the global engineer, through to ever more    common perceptions that international collaborative research is a desirable    objective, through to the phenomena of bibliometrics, rankings and benchmarking    that work at a global scale, contexts are changing.This course is designed to help students better understand the complex    and rapidly changing nature of higher education and research in a globalizing    era. A complementary objective is to experiment with the MOOC platform    and assess how well it works to support international collaborative teaching    and service. We decided to participate in this initiative to engage in    some learning while doing that will build on our experiences in international    collaborative research, advising, and teaching, as well as Kris experience    at UW-Madison with a relative new online course (Geography 340  World    Regions in Global Context).Professors Olds and Robertson began collaborating via a Worldwide Universities    Network (WUN) exchange scheme in the mid-2000s. The University of Bristol    and University of Wisconsin-Madison are both members of the WUN. We very    much look forward to engaging with you about this topic.

TUDO:Most entrepreneurship courses focus on how to start a business. Few focus on the next big entrepreneurial inflection point: how do you successfully grow an existing private business? This is the focus of this Course. It is based on the instructor's research and thirty years of real-world experience advising private growth companies.This Course will challenge how you think about growth; give you tools to help you plan for growth, assess the preconditions to grow, and manage the risks of growth. You will study stories of how five different private businesses faced their growth challenges.Growth, if not properly managed, can overwhelm a business, destroying value and in many cases even causing the business to fail. However, the research shows that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from others' experienceyou do not have to "reinvent the wheel".The Course format is case based. Each case tells a compelling story. You will learn from Julie Allinson, Susan Fellers, Dave Lindsey, Parik Laxinarayan and Eric Barger. In addition, each week, we will discuss a different content theme. In Weeks and 2 and 5, you will engage in Workshops where you will be asked to use and apply the Course tools and concepts to create growth strategies for two different real-life businesses. You will have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow-students to learn from each other as the Course progresses.You will learn about the: "3 Myths of Growth"; the "Truth About Growth"; why growth is like "Mother Nature"; the "Gas Pedal" approach to growth; the all important "4 Ps" of how to grow; and how to scale a business strategically.

Simpler, reactive robots don't need this, but if a robot is to act intelligently, this type of reasoning about actions is vital.

TUDO:Introduction to Genetics and Evolution gives interested people a very basic overview of the principles behind these very fundamental areas of biology. We often hear about new "genome sequences," commercial kits that can tell you about your ancestry (including pre-human) from your DNA or disease predispositions, debates about the truth of evolution, and why animals behave the way they do. This course provides the basic biology you need to understand all of these issues better and tries to clarify some misconceptions. No prior coursework is assumed.

TUDO:This course aims to give students a set of approaches for composition in the style of Classical and Romantic era European art music. The principles and skills in this course engage one asmuch as possible in the thinking of composers from those eras, giving the student compositionalfreedoms that composers of that era enjoyed. The issues of harmonic progression, voice leading, and texture are addressed in addition to relevant compositional concepts such ascommon tones, leading tones, repetition, variation, and elaboration.The course offers presentations, demonstrations, and exercises for self-evaluation. Assessment involves a variety of short compositions in common textures foundduring the 18th and 19th centuries.This course assumes that the student has had exposure to the basic principles of tonalharmony, musicianship, and/or some similar music theory introductory course. Students should befairlycomfortable with roman numeral analysis or, at least, chord symbols and common harmonicprogressions. This course is not aimed exclusively at musicians with a classical musicbackground. Rock, pop, and jazz musicians might find this course interesting as a stylisticcontrast to the genres they usually work in.

TUDO:Teachers face a blizzard of decisions. Scholars estimatethat teachers have over 1000 unique exchanges with students every day, most ofwhich are unplanned and require quick decision making. And then there are themyriad daily decision points related to curriculum planning, assessing studentwork, and interactions with parents and colleagues. Amidst this frenzy, itseasy for bad habits to set in, and hard to break them once they do.The question then becomes:Effective teacher-coaches are not just knowledgeable aboutinstruction; theyre also highly strategic in their approach to changingteachers behaviors. That starts with preparing teachers to receive criticalfeedback, and then continues with a careful selection of goals and scaffolds toensure that feedback is implemented with fidelity.Even teacher coaching thats described as good can sometimesfall short of resulting in meaningful change. The coach might see and say theright things, and the teacher might be very appreciative of the feedback. Butunless the coaching drives true changes in behavior, the good in this casecould actually end up being the enemy of effective.Match Education trains and employs dozens of coaches whoprovide intensive support for teachers in Boston and New Orleans. Courseparticipants will be introduced to Matchs Five key principles of effectivecoaching, which strike the right balance between providing clear direction forteachers, while giving them the support they need to achieve their goals:1)Teachers first need to permit themselves to receivecoaching in order for meaningful change to occur. A skillful coach needs toknow how to ask for and create buy-in for this level of permission. In thissession of the course, we focus on concrete strategies that help teachersreceive and process critical feedback, while maintaining a growth mindsetabout their practice.2)A teacher coaching relationship must begin with a sharedvocabulary for talking about instruction, and a common vision for whatexcellent teaching looks like. In this session of the course, we introduce asimple observation rubric and several video exercises that a coach could usewith a teacher to communicate the parameters of what s/he will be looking forwhen s/he conducts classroom observations.3)Novice teachers, in particular, often describe the feedbackthey receive from expert coaches as akin to drinking from a fire hose theres so much to work on that it becomes difficult to identify and prioritizenext steps for their practice. In this session of the course, we focus on howto analyze classroom instruction and select a single, measurable goal thataddresses a particularly high leverage aspect of a teachers practice.4)We believe that teachers need to leave a coaching feedbacksession with absolute clarity about the steps they should take to achieve theirgoals. However, the clarity of those steps could easily be obscured by a coachwho struggles to deliver candid feedback or to help the teacher articulateconcrete, actionable solutions. In this session, we introduce and practice aprotocol for debriefing a classroom observation that ensures that teachers havethe direction they need to successfully implement a coachs feedback.5)Great coaches dont just leave it to chance that a teacheris ready to implement feedback after merely discussing what to do. They firsttry to create opportunities for the teacher to rehearse or apply the actionsteps in the presence of the coach before the teacher attempts to do it in theclassroom.

TUDO:Design thinking is a popular new idea in the business world. Accelerated by the spectacular rise of Apple and IDEO, design thinking offers an approach better suited for dealing with the accelerating pressures for growth and innovation faced by so many firms and their managers today than business traditional analytic methods. But design thinking can remain mysterious for business students and managers interested in introducing this approach into their decision-making processes. Demystifying it is the focus of this course.Though designing as a craft requires years of dedicated education and talent to master, design thinking, as a problem solving approach, does not. In this course, we work with the following model that contains four questions and ten tools:The four sequential questions that take us on a journey through an assessment of current reality (What is?), the envisioning of a new future (What if?), the development of some concepts for new-business opportunities (What wows?), and the testing of some of those in the marketplace (What works?). The process of design thinking begins with data gathering: at the outset of the design process, designers gather a great deal of data on the users they want to create value for. They mostly do this through ethnographic methods like experience mapping, rather than traditional methods like focus groups and surveys. Farther along in the process, designers make their new ideas concrete (in the form of prototypes) and go out and get better data from the real world in a process that is hypothesis-driven. That is, they treat their new ideas as hypotheses to be tested. They surface the assumptions underlying their hypotheses and test them  usually looking for the kind of behavioral metrics that will allow them to iterate their way to improved value propositions.Accompanying the four questions is a set of new tools to help business people achieve the same kind of disciplined approach to innovation and growth that they bring to the rest of their business.
Phrase:  Design thinking is a popular new idea in the business world
Phrase:   Accelerated by the spectacular rise of Apple and IDEO, design thinking offers an approach better suited for dealing with the accelerating pressures for growth and innovation faced by so many firms and their managers today than business traditional analytic methods
Phrase:   But design thinking can remain mysterious for business students and managers interested in introducing this approach into their decision-making processes
Phrase:   Demystifying it is the focus of this course
Phrase:  Though designing as a craft requires years of dedicated education and talent to master, design thinking, as a problem solving approach, does not
Phrase:   In this course, we work with the following model that contains four questions and ten tools:The four sequential questions that take us on a journey through an assessment of current reality (What is?), the envisioning of a new future (What if?), the development of some concepts for new-business opportunities (What wows?), and the testing of some of those in the marketplace (What works?)
Phrase:   The process of design thinking begins with data gathering: at the outset of the design process, designers gather a great deal of data on the users they want to create value for
Phrase:   They mostly do this through ethnographic methods like experience mapping, rather than traditional methods like focus groups and surveys
Phrase:   Farther along in the process, designers make their new ideas concrete (in the form of prototypes) and go out and get better data from the real world in a process that is hypothesis-driven
Phrase:   That is, they treat their new ideas as hypotheses to be tested

TUDO:Not so long ago, it was almost guaranteed that you would die of an infectious disease. In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying of an infectious disease before you've reached the tender age of 5 would have been extremely high.Since then, science has come a long way in understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria,Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.After weve covered the basics,we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We'll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We'll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends' friends, and so on. And of course well be talking about vaccination too. Well also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology.And yes, we will be talking about Zombies - not human zombies, but zombie ants whose brains are hijacked by an infectious fungus.And there's one more thing: during the course, we'll be running a massive online epidemic with you, the participants - virtually, of course. We're looking forward to having you join us for an exciting course!

TUDO:Discourse on war and peace has gone through a remarkable transition during    the two decades after the end of the Cold War. We do not have to worry    of major nuclear wars, and then, no longer can we anticipate stability    based on nuclear deterrence. We have no immediate threat emanating from    a belligerent adversary equipped with a major arsenal, but we observe a    number of small to medium military powers that are more belligerent than    the days of the Soviet Union. We have more democracies in the world, and    yet are far from the democratic peace that has been imagined by the students    of international relations.This course aims to nail down some of the basic issues that had been argued    in the current research on peace and security. The questions are all deceptively    simple enough, but then the answers will all be ambiguous at best. It is    my hope that you will be able to provide better answers than those given    in the course by developing your own analytical capacity.

TUDO:It is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are typically    modern philosophical problems that emerge with the breakdown of traditional    values, customs and ways of life. The result is the absence of meaning,    the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread    in modernity.The Danish thinker Sren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one of the most penetrating    analyses of this complex phenomenon. But somewhat surprisingly he seeks    insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in an ancient one,    the Greek philosopher Socrates.

TUDO:This course approaches the questions of art and historyfrom the perspective of contemporary makers of art (sculpture, painting,photography, performance, installation and more), animators (whethercharacter/story-based or experimental) and gamers, asking how artists activelymake a history for their own practices by thinking about the creative processas a conversation with a wide range of art from the past. Why are ground-breaking artists so oftenhistorically-minded (and yet tend to break all the rules of conventionalhistory-telling)? How do animatorsthemselves write the largely unwritten history of their art throughquotation, transposition and mash-ups?Why should contemporary gamers look at classical painting anyway?This course will combine short video lectures/interviews andinteractive quizzes with independent, peer-reviewedsketchbook and field work (suggested visits tolocal museums, film viewings, etc.). It isintended to give the student a background in a wide range of visual practices anda greater familiarity with techniques of historical analysis. It will help to build skills in visualanalysis, and will also provide insight into the creative culture of CalArts,where a certain portion of these art histories have been made in the firstplace.

TUDO:The course, lecture, and examples build on each other to teach the fundamentals    of programming in general (logic, loops, functions, objects, classes) and    also deals with advanced topics including multi-threading, events and signals.    Throughout the course, students create meaningful and rewarding expressive    digital instruments that make sound and music in direct response to program    logic. The ChucK language provides precise high-level control over    time, audio computation, and user interface elements (track pad, joysticks,    etc.). ChucK is used (unknowingly in most cases, via SMule Apps)    by millions of users throughout the world, and is the backbone of dozens    of academic programs and laptop orchestras. Learning to program using    ChucK, through the musical examples provided in this course, will prepare    students to program in C++, Java, and other languages. There will be special    guest lectures from creators of the ChucK language, Dr.Ge Wang (Stanford    University) and Dr. Perry R.Cook (Princeton University).

TUDO:A survey of music historybegins with those works of music that convey the artistic trends, innovations,and compositional techniques representative of their time. Rather than offera discussion of Western music focusing on a succession of composers, this coursewill look at key works throughout history: from early music composed as much as athousand years ago, to contemporary concert music written just in the past decade. Throughinteractivehistorical presentations and performances, students will learn how Western music has developed throughout the ages into the rich and diverserepertoire that we have today.What makes this music truly special and important?Distinguished members of the Curtis facultyTwo course presentations eachweek will offer different perspectives on the same work: one that focuses on historical context and description for students with little or no priorexperience in music theory; and one that goes more in-depth into musical structureand formal design. Students are encouraged to watch both lectures to get themost out of the course.

TUDO:In this fast-paced course we will read and encounter and discuss a great range of modern and contemporary U.S. poets working in the "experimental mode," starting with the 19th-century proto-modernists Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and ending with 21st-century conceptual poetics. Aside from providing a perhaps handy or helpful survey and chronology of 20th- and 21st-century poetry, this course offers a way of understanding general cultural transitions from modernism to postmodernism. Some people may wish to enroll as much to gain an understanding of the modernism/postmodernism problem through a study of poetry as to gain access to the work of these many poets. Participants do not need to have any prior knowledge of poetry or poetics. The instructor, Al Filreis, rarely lectures, and frequently calls for "the end of the lecture as we know it"; instead, most of the video-recorded lessons will consist of collaborative close readings led by Filreis, seminar-style -- offering models or samples of readers' interpretations of these knotty but powerful poems, aided by the poetry-minded denizens of the Kelly Writers House on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania.

TUDO:We have learned a lot recently about how the Universe evolved in 13.7 billion years since the Big Bang. More than 80% of matter in the Universe is mysterious Dark Matter, which made stars and galaxies to form. The newly discovered Higgs-boson became frozen into the Universe a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang and brought order to the Universe. Yet we still do not know how ordinary matter (atoms) survived against total annihilation by Anti-Matter. The expansion of the Universe started acceleration about 7 billion years ago and Universe is being ripped apart. The culprit is Dark Energy, a mysterious energy multiplying in vacuum. I will present evidence behind these startling discoveries and discuss what we may learn in the near future.

TUDO:Our relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. Formany musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity,rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalledin the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses toperformers. At the same time, Beethovens music is casually familiar tomillions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musicallyinclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture,yet still represents its summit.This course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatasfrom the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonataand an aspect of Beethovens music exemplified by it. (These might include: therelationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; thecritical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing ofextremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways inwhich the events of his life influenced his compositional process and thecharacter of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysisand historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not amusicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of theperformer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethovens musicitself.

TUDO:Despite the rapid growth of the Chinese economy, the RMB is still not ready to be an international currency. For the RMB to be an international currency, Chinas financial markets should be conceptually well developed. Further, China will have to build up the credibility that the Central Bank can maintain the stability of its currency and ensure full convertibility of the RMB.This self-contained course will discuss our policy views on various topics of RMB internationalization. Specifically, we will provide innovative suggestions on increasing the autonomy of the Peoples Bank of China (PBC), implementing an inflation targeting policy, developing securities markets for corporate borrowing, establishing a flexible and market-determined exchange rate, removing restrictions on capital control, and improving the legal infrastructure and regulations for financial markets. Since the internationalization of Renminbi is of major importance to the further development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre, we will also discuss how this process affects Hong Kong and other Asian economies.

TUDO:My course on Neuroethics originally scheduled for this spring has been postponed until September. I recognize that this will be an inconvenience for some and for that I apologize, but teaching an online course is a new experience for me, as taking one is for many of you, and as I've been preparing the sessions I have discovered that there is some fine-tuning to be done. Since I don't want to compromise on quality I hope you will all understand and bear with me. -- Jonathan D. Moreno, Ph.D.Perhaps a man really dies when his brain stops, when he loses the power to take in a new idea. --George OrwellNeuroethics might well be the most rapidly growing area within bioethics; indeed, in some respects neuroethics has grown as an independent field, with its own journals, professional society and institutional centers. This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that (a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications. This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience. Irrespective of their validity, even the claims that modern neuroscience entails the re-examination of complex and sensitive topics like free will, consciousness, identity, and responsibility raises significant ethical issues. As such, neuroethics asks questions that extend beyond the usual umbrella of biomedical ethics. This course will, therefore, consider the new knowledge and ways of learning about the brain from scientific and ethico-legal and social standpoints. We will examine the core themes of neuroethics, including cognitive enhancement, the nature of the self and personhood, neuroimaging and privacy, and the ways that all these themes are brought together in matters affecting national security.

TUDO:If you use nearly any digital technology, you make use of metadata. Usean ATM today? You interacted with metadata about your account. Searchedfor songs in iTunes or Spotify? You used metadata about those songs. Weuse and even create metadata constantly, but we rarely realize it. Metadata-- or data about data -- describes real and digital objects, so that thoseobjects may be organized now and found later.Metadata is a tool that enables the information age functions performedby humans as well as those performed by computers. Metadata is importantto many fields, particularly Computer Science; but this course is not purelya Computer Science course. This course approaches Metadata from the perspectiveof Information Science, which is a broad interdisciplinary field that studieshow people create and manage information.

TUDO:This course will teach the student how to survive when everything we normallytake for granted is gone, when the structures we depend on have failed.We will examine the Disaster Cycle, particularly the Mitigation and Recoveryphases. Students will prepare an extensive personal preparedness plan coveringsuch topics as supplies, communication, food and water, shelter, security,and comfort (yes even in survival there can and should be comfort). Wealso look at preparedness on the institutional and government levels.We will look beyond these plans towards the one aspect of survival, whichwill enable a person to survive when all planning has failed. Disasters,by definition, overwhelm all available resources. If all available resourcesare gone, only one thing will keep a person alive and that is their attitude.A persons awareness and attitude, the two are closely linked, allow a personthe means to remain calm, avoid panic, and draw upon resources within andoutside the person to survive when their world has failed. In truth noteveryone survives in extreme circumstances; people die, but, even in death,attitude, if it cannot save you, provides some degree or comfort.

TUDO:What is Climate Change? How should we respond toClimate Change? These questions are complex, not least because the responsesavailable to us depend upon who is providing the answers and the particularperspective they take. The economist sees the economic challenges andopportunities of Climate Change; the scientist sees the need to describe andexplain Climate Change; the policy-maker and social scientistsee Climate Change as a social problem. Therefore, the first step tounderstanding Climate Change and what we do about it is to see how experts fromdifferent disciplines engage withthe issue. The second step is to appreciate howour response to Climate Change depends upon the interplay between thesedifferent approaches.This course offers you an introduction to differentdisciplinary perspectives on Climate Change to help you think about how Climate Changeaffects you as an individual, as a member of your local community, as a citizenof your country and as a member of the global community. We have designed thepresentations, discussions, activities and assessment tasks in this course tohelp you understand what Climate Change is and what you  and we  should do about it.

TUDO:The course objective is to enable each student to enhance his or her quantitativescientific reasoning about problems related to human health. Biostatisticsis about quantitative approaches - ideas and skills - to address bioscienceand health problems. To achieve mastery of biostatistics skills, a studentmust see one, do one, teach one. Therefore, the course is organized topromote regular practice of new ideas and methods.The course is organized into 3 self-contained two-week modules. Each moduleexcept the first is built around an important health problem.Thefirst module reviews the scientific method and the role of experimentationand observation to generate data, or evidence, relevant to selecting amongcompeting hypotheses about the natural world. Bayes theorem is used toquantify the concept of evidence. Then, we will discuss what is meant bythe notion of cause.In the second module, we use a national survey dataset to estimate thecosts of smoking and smoking-caused disease in American society. The conceptsof point and interval estimation are introduced. Students will master theuse of confidence intervals to draw inferences about population means anddifferences of means. They will use stratification and weighted averagesto compare subgroups that are otherwise similar in an attempt to estimatethe effects of smoking and smoking-caused diseases on medical expenditures.

TUDO:The past decade has seen an explosion of new mechanisms for understanding and using location information in widely-accessible technologies. This Geospatial Revolution has resulted in the development of consumer GPS tools, interactive web maps, and location-aware mobile devices. These radical advances are making it possible for people from all walks of life to use, collect, and understand spatial information like never before.This course brings together core concepts in cartography, geographic information systems, and spatial thinking with real-world examples to provide the fundamentals necessary to engage with Geography beyond the surface-level. We will explore what makes spatial information special, how spatial data is created, how spatial analysis is conducted, and how to design maps so that theyre effective at telling the stories we wish to share. To gain experience using this knowledge, we will work with the latest mapping and analysis software to explore geographic problems.

TUDO:Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course is a continuation ofand explains the inner workings of public-key systems and cryptographic protocols.  Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with constructions for digital signatures and their applications.  We will then discuss protocols for user authentication and zero-knowledge protocols.  Next we will turn to privacy applications of cryptography supporting anonymous credentials and private database lookup. We will conclude with more advanced topics including multi-party computation and elliptic curve cryptography. Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field.  The course will include written homeworks and optional programming labs. The material is self-contained, but the course assumes knowledge of the topics covered inas well as a basic understanding of discrete probability theory.

TUDO:This course, part 2 of a 2-course sequence, examines thehistory of rock, primarily as it unfolded in the United States,from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. This course covers the music of Led Zeppelin, the Allman Brothers, Carole King, Bob Marley, the Sex Pistols, Donna Summer, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Metallica, Run-DMC, and Nirvana,and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments inthe music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.Emerging out of the experimental and ambitious years of late-60s psychedelia, rock splintered into a variety of styles in the 1970s as the music business continued to expand. By the end of the decade, punk and disco had challenged the excesses of thehippie aesthetic, as rock became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly. The emergence and rise of MTV transformed pop music and propelled the careers of Michael jackson and Madonna, while heavy metal and hip hop dominated the late 1980s. Nirvana leads alt-rock'sreturn to simplicity in the early 1990s.

TUDO:Geoscientists definea living planet as one with active volcanism. By this definition our Earth isvery much alive, with many eruptions each year and with a far greater number ofactive volcanoes that can potentially erupt in any given year.In detail, each eruption isdifferent. Every volcano is its own physical and chemical system, occurs in itsown geological location, is subjected to its local stress field, and is at itsown stage in evolution in geological time.External triggers of volcanic eruptions are also believed to play animportant role.Yet powerful generalisationsand models of volcanic eruptions are indeed possible and in fact very useful indealing with the consequences of volcanic eruptions.How are such modelsconstructed? They must rest on a basis of a mechanistic understanding of whatvolcanoes are, and what they are doing  not just during eruptions but also inthe events leading up to eruptions, and not just at the Earths surface butalso at depth, where the magma is being prepared for the next eruption.In addition tofield observations of past eruptions, monitoring of signals from magmaticsystems, and computer-based simulation of volcanic eruptions, increasingly,high pressure and high temperature experiments are employed in order to answerthe question of how volcanic systems work.These controlled laboratory conditionsfor experimental volcanology are transforming the study of volcanoes from achiefly observational discipline where eruptive mechanisms were developed viatheoretical analysis of such observations, into a fully modern scientificdiscipline where such theoretical approaches are either verified or rejected,by the experimental picture of what is possible and what is not.This course shows you how such experimental insight isobtained and what it tells us about erupting volcanoes.

TUDO:In thiscourse, you will learn about the conserved, molecular machinery that eliminatescells through programmed cell death type I, also referred to as apoptosis.Through apoptosis many cells are eliminated from our body during developmentand throughout adult life, and deregulated apoptosis can lead to variousdiseases such as cancer and auto-immune diseases. Rather than just telling youabout the molecular machinery of apoptosis and how it works to kill cells, Iwill walk you through and discuss with you the critical experiments that led tothe discovery of the key components of this molecular machinery and themechanisms through which they function.I will alsodiscuss how apoptosis research can help to develop noveltherapeuticsand consider the questions that remain open inthe field.The coursewill cover the following topics:1.Introductionto programmed cell death and apoptosis2.TheBCL-2 family of proteins3.Apafproteins4.Caspases5.Mechanismsthat regulate apoptosis6.Non-apoptoticfunctions of components of the central apoptosis machinery7.Diseasescaused by deregulated apoptosis

TUDO:While the human genome sequence hastransformed our understanding of human biology, it isnt just the sequence ofyour DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are some genes activatedand others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.Epigenetics has been a hot topic for researchover the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic controlcontributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritablethrough cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly tomutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations,epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to bemanipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years thatepigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet),which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.This course will give an introduction to thefundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena thatare manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus onmammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and theenvironment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.

TUDO:When you take a digital photo with your phone or transform the image in Photoshop, when you play a video game or watch a movie with digital effects, when you do a web search or make a phone call, you are using technologies that build upon linear algebra. Linear algebra provides concepts that are crucial to many areas of computer science, including graphics, image processing, cryptography, machine learning, computer vision, optimization, graph algorithms, quantum computation, computational biology, information retrieval and web search. Linear algebra in turn is built on two basic elements, the matrix and the vector.In this class, you will learn the concepts and methods of linear algebra, andhow to use themto think about problems arising in computer science. You will write small programs in the programming language Python to implement basic matrix and vector functionality and algorithms, and use these to process real-world data to achieve such tasks as: two-dimensional graphics transformations, face morphing, face detection, image transformations such as blurring and edge detection, image perspective removal, audio and image compression, searching within an image or an audio clip, classification of tumors as malignant or benign, integer factorization, error-correcting codes, secret-sharing, network layout, document classification, and computing Pagerank (Google's ranking method).

TUDO:Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining    what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. The current    understanding of human history and social theory is based largely on Western    experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This    course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience    during the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of the    new scholarship of discovery divided into three independent parts, which    means that students can take any Part without prior or subsequent attendance    of the other Parts. Part 1 addresses the issue of Who Gets What and covers    sequentially inequality and education, education and social mobility, social    mobility and wealth distribution, and wealth distribution and regime change.    Part 2 turns to the related issue of Who Survives and includes studies    of inequality and population behavior, population behavior and human development,    human development and social organization, and social organization and    social stratification. Part 3 deals with issues of identification and motivation    and presents studies of religion and gender, ethnicity, and nationalism    from late imperial times to the present-day.Our class eschews the standard chronological narrative arc for an analytic    approach that focuses on specific discoveries and on how these new facts    complicate our understanding of comparative societies, human behavior,    and the construction of individual and group identities. That being said,    while we do not emphasize the temporal narratives of late imperial, early    modern and contemporary China, we of course also discuss change over time    as China progresses from a largely domestic imperial history to the shared    stories of imperialism and semi colonialism, communism and collectivization,    and reform and globalization.

TUDO:Vaccines are evaluated through a series of clearly defined controlled    studies to assess these investigational products for safety, immunogenicity    and efficacy before they are approved for licensure. All clinical    vaccine trials are bound by international ethical guidelines and, in the    case of US trials, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.Good Clinical Practice is defined by the International Conferences on    Harmonization (ICH) as: A standard for the design, conduct, performance,    monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials    that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible    and accurate, and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial    subjects are protected.Thats a tall order, so how is it done? Individuals who enroll as    subjects in these trials play an essential role in the development and    evaluation of new and improved candidate vaccines. They are average    citizens who volunteer to roll up their sleeves and, in the process, make    a tremendous difference in society. So why do they volunteer and    what safeguards do we put in place to protect their rights, safety and    well-being while in the trial? What are the responsibilities of the    investigators, sponsors and ethics committees who conduct and oversee these    trials?Along with our colleagues, we will introduce you to how GCP is applied    in clinical vaccine trials to ensure proper and ethical scientific conduct.    The course will use examples from real vaccine trials to demonstrate the    application of the FDA Code of Federal Regulations and ICH GCP Guidelines    to explore methods and best practices involved in implementing phase I    and II vaccine clinical trials. This short course offering through    Coursera is based on our work at the Center for Immunization Research and    an in-depth graduate course taught at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School    of Public Health.We hope it inspires you to work in this exciting field.

TUDO:Unlike many oral communication courses and textbooks, this class spendsa fair bit of time working through the unique traits of oral versus writtencommunication in order to help students prepare speeches that are easierto deliver orally and understand aurally. The classs focus on understandingthe key parts of an argument and drafting clear and concise arguments translatesdirectly to other academic assignments. In service of this goal, we willstudy the principles of argumentation and arrangement; critically examineour own speeches and the speeches of others. By becoming a student of publicspeaking, you join a long history of rhetorical study dating back to ancientGreece.

TUDO:This course is about molecular evolution - the evolution of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules. The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will cover the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem.A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (, neighbor joining).Often, the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are investigating. For instance, knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified, uncharacterized, pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle, thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic treebe an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer.Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology).Topics covered:

TUDO:Cybercrime has become both more widespread and harder to battle. Researchers and anecdotalexperience show that the cybercrime scene is becoming increasingly organizedand consolidated, with strong links also to traditional criminal networks.Modern attacks are indeed stealthy and often profit oriented.Malicious software (malware) is the traditional way in which cybercriminals infect userand enterprise hosts to gain access to their private, financial, andintellectual property data. Once stolen, such information can enable moresophisticated attacks, generate illegal revenue, and allow for cyber-espionage.By mixing a practical, hands-on approach with the theory and techniques behind the scene, the course discusses the current academic and underground research in thefield, trying to answer the foremost question about malware and undergroundeconomy, namely, "Should we care?".Students will learn how traditional and mobile malware work, how they are analyzed anddetected, peering through the underground ecosystem that drives this profitablebut illegal business.Understanding how malware operates is of paramount importance to form knowledgeable experts, teachers, researchers, and practitioners able to fight back.  Besides, it allows us to gather intimate knowledge of the systems and the threats, which is a necessary step to successfully devise novel, effective, and practical mitigation techniques.

TUDO:This course is about understanding the determinants of health from a broadperspective. We focus on how social relationships and institutions -- suchas familial relationships, national policies, and global economic forces-- promote or undermine the health of populations. The course covers existingevidence of health disparities, research methods, and theories relevantto the topic.The course is interesting because it reveals the so-called fundamentalcauses of disease and health disparities recognizable within social groups.For example, we examine why a flu germ can affect whole groups of peopledifferently. In short, the course challenges the notion that health isa narrowly defined medical problem.Students in the course will listen to lectures, read provided materials,and complete quizzes and tests that examine comprehension and one's abilityto synthesize ideas.

TUDO:Statistical Molecular Thermodynamics is a course in physical chemistrythat relates the microscopic properties of molecules to the macroscopic behaviorof chemical systems. Quantized molecular energy levels and their use in theconstruction of molecular and ensemble partition functions is described.Thermodynamic state functions, their dependence on the partition function, andtheir relationships with one another (as dictated by the three Laws ofThermodynamics) are all examined in detail. Analysis and demonstration takesplace primarily in the context of ideal and real gases. This eight-week coursecovers slightly more than half of a typical semester-long course in chemicalthermodynamics. Typical topics to be addressed subsequently would be phaseequilibria, liquids, solutions of non-electrolytes and electrolytes, andchemical reaction equilibria.Students who successfully complete the course will be able to predict how changes in molecular properties will influence the macroscopic behavior of those substances; they will understand the relationships between energy, heat, and work, and be able to predict how much work can be extracted from a given chemical process under various sets of conditions; they will understand the role of entropy in physical and chemical processes; and they will be able to engineer conditions to make chemical reactions spontaneously favorable (or not). Students will also become adept with differential calculus as a tool to derive and manipulate relationships between connected thermodynamic variables and state functions.

TUDO:You have one liver but three patients are awaiting a liver transplant. Who should get the liver? What criteria should be used to select the recipient? Is it fair to give it to an alcoholic? These are some of the questions that arise in the context of rationing and allocating scarce health care resources among particular individuals. These are called micro-allocation decisions. There are also macro-allocation decisions that focus on how health care systems distribute resources across populations. Using the cases of organs for transplantation, the rationing for vaccines in a flu pandemic, and oncology drug shortages, the course will critically examine alternative theories for allocating scarce resources among individuals. Using both the need to establish priorities for global health aid and to define an essential benefit package for health insurance, the course will critically examine diverse theories for macro-allocation from cost-effectiveness analysis to age-based rationing to accountability for reasonableness. There are no prerequisites or required knowledge to take this course.

TUDO:This course explores the basic concepts and terms needed to understand    the science of climate change, and the available mitigation, adaptation    and policy options. By the end of the course, students will be able to:Tell the story of our climate, describing how interactions among    atmosphere, ocean, land, and life lead to climatic changes at all timescalesEvaluate the likely effect of historical human fossil emissions    and land use changes on Earths energy balance and climate.Describe the direct observations of climate change in recent decades, and articulate the evidence attributing global    warming in this time period to human causes.Assess the utility - and limits - of climate models to predict    global and regional climate change.Articulate the demographic, economic, technological and political    factors that influence both humans impact on the climate and humans vulnerability    to climate change.Express an informed opinion on the scope and urgency of the efforts    needed to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.We provide the scientific basics of climate change paired with the    response options (mitigation and adaptation) and policy landscape. Focusing    exclusively on the science of climate change may not allow a nuanced understanding    of the social implications of this science. Similarly, political    or economic analyses of climate change frequently neglect the underlying    mechanics behind climate change thresholds, feedbacks, and the potential    for abrupt change. This course explores linkages between climate change    and other pressing priorities such as human health, poverty, community    livability, economic resilience, and other environmental problems (such    as biodiversity and water quality). We acknowledge the urgent need    to design innovative strategies that realize multiple objectives (or co-benefits)    simultaneously, and explore the particular capacity for sustainability    and climate change to provide an avenue for achieving these objectives.

TUDO:This course, part 1 of a 2-course sequence, examines thehistory of rock, primarilyas it unfolded in the United States,from the days before rock (pre-1955) to the end of the 1960s. This course covers the music of Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Phil Spector,Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments inthe music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed.Rock emerged in the mid 1950s as a blending of mainstream pop, rhythm and blues, and country and western--styles that previouslyhad remained relatively separate. This new style became the music of the emerging youth culture and was often associated with teen rebellion. We will follow the story of how this rowdy first wave of rock and roll (1955-59) was tamed in the early 60s but came roaring back with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and then went psychedelicby the end of the decade.

TUDO:Students who complete this class will understand that analytical instruments are not black boxes, but rather complex tools whose utility depends in detail on how analysts both configure and apply them. Towards that end there are three pimary objectives. First, students will learn facts about major classes of instruments commonly used in chemical analysis. Their knowledge will be captured by the ability to block diagram these complex pieces of equipment, and tailor the specifications to the measurement needs. Second, the course will cover the basics of instrumental calibration and quality control. Analysts will develop the ability to apply calibration curves, internal standards and the method of standard addition as needed for various measurement problems. Finally, students must learn how to select and tailor the best instrumental method given a particular measurement need. This higher level skill involves critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the various method, and the ability to understand the context behind a measurement need.

TUDO:We are part of the 'TechniCity'. The increasing availability ofnetworks, sensors and mobile technologies allows for new approaches toaddress the challenges that our cities face. The way we understand citiesis undergoing sweeping transformation, right along with the analyticaltools we use to design our cities and the communication tools we use toengage people. Absorbing, studying and understanding the role of technologyfrom a critical viewpoint allows us to generate creative ideas for improvingour cities.This course begins by examining how our cities are changing. We then jumpinto how technology is used to engage with the public to support decision-making.Students will be examining tools for analyzing the city. Then we move intoexploring the infrastructure that makes the real-time, technologically-enhancedcity possible. And rounding out the course is an exploration of entrepreneurialurbanism, looking at how creativity can spawn technological innovation.You'll hear from technological innovators and thought leaders about allof these topics.

TUDO:Great leaders move us through our emotions. They establish a deep emotional    connection with others called resonance. Their own levels of emotional    intelligence allow them to create and nurture these resonant relationships.    They use their EI as a path to resonant leadership through mindfulness,    hope, compassion, and playfulness. Unfortunately, most people in leadership    and helping positions (i.e., doctors, teachers, coaches, etc.) lose their    effectiveness over time because of the cumulative damage from chronic stress.    But humans can renew themselves, neurologically, hormonally, and emotionally.Based on decades ofresearch into emotional intelligencecompetencies    and longitudinal studies of their development, the course will examine    resonance and developing "resonant leadership" capability,emotional    intelligence, and the experiences of mindfulness, hope, and compassion.    Using the latest in neuroscience, behavioral, organizational and psychological    research, participants willunderstand the theory, research, and experience    of the Positive Emotional Attractor that is an essential beginning to sustained,    desired change for individuals, teams, organizations and communities.

TUDO:Computation and simulation are increasingly important in all aspects of    science and engineering. At the same time writing efficient computer programs    to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult.    Even laptops now have 4 or more processors, but using them all to solve    a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce    parallelism, and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism.    Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic,    computer architecture, and memory hierarchies.Although parallel computing will be covered, this isa class    on the most advanced techniques for using supercomputers, which these days    have tens of thousands of processors and cost millions of dollars. Instead,    the goal is to teach tools that you can use immediately on your own laptop,    desktop, or a small cluster. Cloud computing will also be discussed, and    students who don't have a multiprocessor computer of their own will still    be able to do projects using Amazon Web Services at very low cost.Along the way there will also be discussion of software engineering tools    such as debuggers, unit testing, Makefiles, and the use of version control    systems. After all, your time is more valuable than computer time, and    a program that runs fast is totally useless if it produces the wrong results.High performanceis also an important aspect of high    performance scientific computing, and so another main theme of the course    is the use of basic tools and techniques to improve your efficiency as    a computational scientist.

TUDO:Most entrepreneurship courses focus on how to start a business. Few focus    on the next big entrepreneurial inflection point: how do you successfully    grow an existing private business? This is the focus of this Course. It    is based on the instructor's research and thirty years of real-world experience    advising private growth companies.This Course will focus on the common people challenges private growth    companies face as they grow. You will study stories of how six different    private businesses faced their growth challenges.While strategic focus and operational excellence are necessary to build    a great growth company, they are not sufficient. Growth requires the right    kind of leadership, culture, and people. My research clearly showed that    many entrepreneurs struggle with personal challenges presented to them    by growth, as well as the challenge of hiring the right people and building    the right management team that can play well together. The research shows    that every growth business faces common challenges. You can learn from    others' experienceyou do not have to "reinvent the wheel".The Course format is story based. Each case tells a compelling story.    You will learn from Barbara Lynch, Ryan Dienst, Steve Ritter, Randy Bufford,    John Gabbert, and Mike Cote. In addition, each week, we will discuss a    different content theme. In Week 3, you will engage in a Workshop where    you will be asked to apply the Growth System Assessment Tool. You will    have the opportunity to create a Course Community of fellow students to    learn from each other as the Course progresses.You will learn how entrepreneurs must grow, too; the secret of high    performance; people-centric leadership; how to create high employee engagement;    how to create an internal Growth System; and how to build a senior management    team.

Go back 300 years before the eighteenthcentury, and not much was different. Butcome forward 300 years to the present, and we see a startling transformation.Incomesin some parts of the world have increased more than ten-fold; and now it mostcertainly does matter where you live  with income differentials of 50 timesbetween the worlds richest and poorest countries. What has changed in the past 300 years is thedevelopment and application of new technologies at a pace unprecedented inhuman history  the steam engine, electricity and the computer, to name just afew. With these developments, for thosewho have access to them, have come huge gains in living standards.Inthis course well explore the spectacular (but uneven) story of economicdevelopment  beginning with the Malthusian era, moving on to the take-off ofgrowth in the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence in livingstandards that followed, and finishing in the present with the Global FinancialCrisis. Well cover the main episodesand events in the development of the world economy in the past 300 years, andhave something to say about most regions of the world.
